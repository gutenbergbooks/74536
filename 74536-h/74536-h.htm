<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The pleasure which you
take in reading, made
me solicitous to write a
few pages for your amusement,
when you wish to unbend
your mind from more
serious studies. But the want
of opportunity, and the frequent
interruptions which I
met with during the course
of them, have rendered the
whole less worthy your acceptance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>than I had hoped,
when I first formed the design.
My affection for you,
incites me to wish your improvement
in every branch
of useful knowledge; and
though this little work may
be regarded as <i>trifling</i>, yet,
the <i>moral</i> which it contains,
is worthy your most serious
attention. Do not, therefore,
be too proud to receive instruction
from its contents,
because you have commenced
acquaintance with <i>Greek</i> or
<i>Latin</i> authors. It is from a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>superficial knowledge either
of men or books, that we derive
a supercilious contempt
of the one, or are critically
nice in our judgment of the
other. I would wish you,
my dear boy, to form your
taste on the most perfect models;
but to profit by every
thing which is praise-worthy
in those authors who are less
distinguished. Above all, you
should remember, that to improve
your <i>temper</i>, and to encrease
in <i>virtue</i> as well as
<i>knowledge</i>, is the great end
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>of all your studies; nothing
which can promote this design,
can be too low to merit
your attention. That you
may each day continue to advance
in your progress towards
every thing which is great,
generous, and manly, till you
become an ornament of society,
a blessing to your friends,
and the delight of your indulgent
parents, is the most
earnest wish of,</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>“It is a delightful morning!”
said a gentleman to a boy
of about twelve years old, as he
walked up and down an avenue
with high trees on each side, which
led to a handsome house. A
coach drove, at that moment, out
of the court-yard. “What a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>fine day!” repeated the gentleman.
“I think, <i>William</i>, the roads will
be extremely pleasant.” <i>William</i>
made no answer. The tears trickled
down his cheeks, which he wiped
away with the back of his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>A little chimney-sweeper had
crept along till he came to the
place; and tossing down his bag of
soot at the foot of a tree, stood
gazing at the cloaths of the young
gentleman, and secretly wished he
was but as happy. He beckoned
to his companion, who sat at a
little distance gnawing a stale crust,
which he had received from the
good-nature of a neighbouring farmer;
and as he came forward,
“Look, <i>Jack</i>,” said he, “what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>a fine coach that is, with those
long tail nags: that boy is going
to ride, I warrant; and yet he
looks as sad as if he was one of
us. I wonder what such fine
folks can have to make them uneasy.
If I was that boy, and
had my belly-full, as he has, and
such good cloaths to my back, and
might ride in that same coach, I
should be as happy as a king.
<i>O how I wish I was that boy!</i>”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>William</i> turned round at this
speech, and smiling at the chimney-sweeper,
asked him his name?
The poor fellow, with a scrape
of his foot, which he meant as
a bow of respect, told him, that
his name was <i>Tony Climbwell</i>; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>that he lived at the next village.
“Well then, <i>Tony</i>,” replied <i>William</i>,
“I would advise you not
to envy every one you see; for
I would willingly change places
with you to enjoy your liberty.
I am going back to school, <i>Tony</i>,
after a month’s holidays; and if
you knew how unhappy I am when
there, you would pity my situation;
and not envy the joys of
it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The gentleman before-mentioned,
had gone into the house to
enquire for his lady, who was to
complete the party, and convey
his son to school. It was in this
interval, that the following conversation
passed between the two
boys and the young gentleman.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“Indeed, master,” replied <i>Tony</i>,
“if we <i>could</i> change places, you
would find you had made but a
sorry choice. Our liberty, as you
call it, is not to do as we like.
To be sure, I am a very poor
boy, and have had no learning;
for I can neither read nor spell;
but if I take it right, <i>liberty</i>
means something such as to be
your own master, don’t it? at
least, I know when <i>Simon Pennyless</i>
was sent to goal, people said,
“That the next week he would
be set at liberty;” and that was,
that he was to be let out again.
Now <i>we</i> go about every morning
sweeping chimnies”——“And
walk,” said <i>William</i>, interrupting
him, “where you please all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>rest of the day. At our school
we have scarce any time for play,
and are confined from six till
eight, from nine till twelve, and
from two till five o’clock, without
any amusement whatever.
Don’t tell me, therefore, <i>Tony</i>,
that our life is not much more
uncomfortable than your’s. Besides
which, we have long tasks
to learn after school-hours are
over; and are thrashed, and scolded,
if we cannot say them perfect;
and then to think it will
be <i>six</i> months before I see my
father and mother!”——<i>William</i>
wept again; the thought was too
pathetic for his feelings; and he
drew his fore-finger across his left
eye, and then stroaked it the contrary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>way, to wipe off the drops
which stood trembling in his
right.—“But I have no father
or mother,” replied <i>Tony</i>, “nor
a single soul in the world to
care what becomes of me, except
my mistress, who is the best woman
that ever lived; and would
give me some victuals if she could;
but she dares not for her own
sake; for her husband is so cruel,
that he would beat her if she
did. He makes us work hard;
and starves us into the bargain.
This poor fellow,” added he,
pointing to his companion, “whom
we call <i>Little Shock</i>, from his
curling locks, is but six years
old; and has been bound apprentice
this twelvemonth; and I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>no older myself when I first went
to my master, which is near seven
years ago; and I love the boy
dearly, that I do, as much as
if he was my own brother; and
frequently do I get the broom
thrown at my head, because I
do not beat him when he cries
at going up a narrow chimney,
or does not sweep it as he should
do.” “But is not your master
<i>obliged</i> to give you food enough?”
said <i>William</i>. “Why don’t you
complain to somebody? I would,
if I was in your place.” “Ah!
Sir,” replied the sooty-faced boy,
“you talk like a gentleman, and
know nothing of the matter.
Whom would you have us complain
to? And do not you think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>our master would use us much
worse if we did? You wished
just now to change places with
us; but if you did, you would
soon alter your mind.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As he pronounced these last
words, the carriage which had
been waiting, drove to a little
distance, to make way for another
coach, which then arrived. It
contained a very venerable looking
old gentleman, whom <i>William</i> called
his grandfather, and immediately
left the chimney-sweepers
to welcome; and with great
expressions of joy, accompanied
him into the house. They were
met in the hall by the gentleman
and lady before-mentioned,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>whom I shall call by the name
of <i>Sedley</i>. After the usual compliments
were over, and they
had informed their father, Mr.
<i>Graves</i>, of their intention to take
<i>William</i> to school, he begged a
reprieve for him for a few days,
as he much wished to enjoy the
pleasure of his company. A compliance
with this request dissipated
the sadness of <i>William</i>’s countenance;
and he jumped about
with a degree of vivacity that
seemed to afford pleasure to all
his friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. <i>Graves</i> was one of those
old men, whose features are always
impressed with such marks
of good-nature as are pleasing to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>the volatile spirits of youth.
Though he was turned of eighty,
he would sometimes partake in
the diversions of his grandson;
and while his instructions commanded
respect, his mildness and
affability excited the warmest affection.
When he had taken his
afternoon’s nap in an easy chair,
which was placed in one corner
of the room for that purpose, he
got up, and after shaking his
cloaths, stroaking down his ruffles,
and adjusting his wig, asked
<i>William</i> if he was disposed
for a walk.</p>

<p class='c007'>They sallied out together, the
invitation being willingly accepted.
The good man taking his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>stick in one hand, and resting
the other on the shoulder of his
young companion, enquired whether
he had had any conversation
with the black boys, with
whom, at his arrival, he had
found him engaged. <i>William</i> repeated
the substance of what had
passed; and concluded with saying,
“He believed he <i>was</i> happier
than honest <i>Tony</i>, though
it must almost counterbalance all
his sufferings to be exempted from
the constant uneasiness of learning
a task.” “I am sorry,” replied
Mr. <i>Graves</i>, “that you
have formed such a wrong estimate
of your situation in life;
and I should have expected, that
the striking incident of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>morning, would have taught you
to be contented and thankful
with the real happiness of your
lot. Though I am a very old
man, <i>William</i>, I have not forgotten
what were my own troubles
at your time of life. Study I
often found to be irksome, and
confinement the heaviest of all
evils; and therefore, I shall not
preach to you, that you will never
in future be so happy as you
now are; because, if you feel
yourself to be otherwise, you will
pay little attention to such an
assurance: but thus much I will
say, and hope you will credit
my experience, that all the uneasiness
you complain of, may be
<i>mitigated</i>, if not entirely overcome,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>by your own diligence and resolution.
It is by idleness and
neglect, that your difficulties are
encreased. The more disagreeable
you find your studies, the
more you are disposed to postpone
the necessary attention which
they require. But this, my dear
boy, is a very wrong method.
The <i>beginning</i> of every attempt
will always be irksome; but those
who are too indolent to bestow
a continued degree of care and
assiduity, will never arrive at perfection.
<i>My William</i> cannot be
destitute of emulation; if he sees
others excel, he must wish to
equal their attainments. It is the
meanest of human minds, that
will <i>envy</i> another’s merit; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>the noblest disposition will endeavour
to improve by a good example.
Every state has its troubles.
When you leave school,
the <i>same</i> cares will not perplex
you, but <i>others</i> equally severe
may arise, which now you are
unacquainted with. Have you
not oftentimes been taught, that
every period of life has its particular
duties; and the duty of
your age and station is to attend
to the instructions of your masters,
and to learn what they desire
you, when they require it with
cheerfulness?” “Then surely,
Sir,” replied <i>William</i>, “<i>Tony</i> is
in a happier state than I am,
since he has no tasks to get by
heart; and his <i>duty</i> of sweeping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>a chimney is easily performed.
I should like to sweep a chimney
of all things.” “Perhaps
you might,” returned his grandfather.
“Any thing will give
us pleasure when we do it for
amusement; but should you like
to have the broom thrown at
your head when you had done?
or should you enjoy going without
your meals, and strolling about
in all weathers to beg from
strangers the miserable supply to
your hunger? It is very wrong
to wish for a change of situation
with any one, since none can be
acquainted with the secret uneasiness
of his neighbour’s mind.
<i>Tony</i> had some reason indeed to
wish for your station in life;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>but even <i>he</i> would have been deceived;
for had he made the
exchange, and been possessed of
your inclinations with your fortune,
he would still have found
himself disappointed; since you
esteemed yourself at that moment
as the most unhappy being, in
the necessity of returning to school,
and was prevented by the error
of your desires from any enjoyment
of your superior advantages.
This is a useful lesson, my child,
to teach you contentment; for,
believe me, though trials and
temptations of the poor, are in
most cases stronger than you can
any ways imagine, if <i>you</i> are
inclined, by a love of play, to
leave your studies, and desert your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>duty, reflect how often <i>they</i> may
be tempted to steal from others
those necessary comforts of which
they stand in need; and how
much they are exposed to the
danger of becoming wicked from
the example of others and their
own ignorance! I should like to
see your new chimney-sweeper
acquaintance,” continued Mr.
<i>Graves</i>, “and though I do not
approve of your mixing with such
companions, I think you should
not have left him without relieving
his wants: perhaps he
might have been very hungry,
and has not had a good dinner
since, as you have, to satisfy his
appetite.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span><i>William</i> was backward and somewhat
stupid at his learning, but
he wanted not sense; and his tenderness
and good-nature were uncommon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor fellow,” said he, “your
arrival, and the joy of seeing
you, made me forget him; but
I will find out where he lives,
and do all I can to make amends
for my forgetfulness.—Dear Sir,
will you go with me? it is not
a long way; we are now in sight
of the village.” “Though the
distance is not very great,” replied
Mr. <i>Graves</i>, “yet the winding path,
which leads to it, is
farther than I can reach without
fatigue. I will therefore rest myself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>upon the stump of this tree,
and shall be entertained in your
absence with the prospect of the
country: the view of which, from
this eminence, is delightful.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>William</i> set off, with a degree
of swiftness that promised a speedy
return; but he had not proceeded
far, when he was met by a
<i>Jew</i>, who sold trinkets of various
sorts; as buttons, watch-chains,
pencils, and such like
things. He offered his wares to
<i>William</i>, who at first refused to
purchase them; but the man telling
him he might as well look
at, if he did not buy them; he
was tempted to ask the price of
an ivory bilberkit, for which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>paid a shilling. A small looking-glass,
was a thing he had
long wished for; and as that was
the same expence, he debated for
a considerable time before he
could determine which of the
two to make choice of. One
moment he began, to play with
the toy, and the next surveyed
himself in the glass. Alternatively
taking them up and laying
them down, till the owner,
who saw his eagerness for both,
persuaded him to have them.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was walking slowly on,
with his purchase in his hand,
when a butcher’s boy, and a lad
who was driving some cows from
the field to be milked, overtook
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>him with a nest of blackbirds, in
which were four young ones.
<i>William</i> asked what they would
take for their prize? which they
at first refused to sell; but afterwards
said, he should have it for
a shilling. He objected that it
was too much; and taking out
his money, found that he had
only half a guinea, which had
been given him to take to school,
and which, therefore, he did not
chuse to change, and nine-pence
half-penny, for which the boys
agreed at last he should have the
blackbirds.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once more then he proceeded
in his journey to look for <i>Tony</i>.
He soon found the house, and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>black acquaintance with a young
child, whom he was teaching to
walk. They renewed their intimacy,
and <i>William</i> told him the
design of his <i>visit</i>; but coloured
with confusion when he recollected
the situation of his money,
which he had never thought of
when he was making his bargains.
He did not at all like to own
the true state of the case, nor
did he know what method to
pursue. He wished to keep his
gold for many reasons, and he
had beside, neither silver nor copper.
His <i>conscience</i> urged him
to give <i>Tony</i> something; but he
had pleased himself greatly with
the thought of having a half-guinea
in his pocket, which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>could call his own. His sensibility
represented the wants of
the orphan boy but the pride
of having a piece of <i>gold</i> in his
possession, overcame every consideration
of pity. “If you will
call to-morrow at our house,
<i>Tony</i>,” said he, “you shall have
some bread and meat.—Good bye,
I cannot stay any longer!” And
away he went, with the uneasy
consciousness of having behaved
wrong.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was on his return to his
grandfather, when <i>Jeffery Squander</i>
and his sister, who were taking
a walk, met him as he was
crossing by the end of a lane.
They had stopped to buy some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>plum-cakes of a man with one
leg, who made it his business to
carry them about. <i>Jeffery</i> and
<i>William</i> were neighbours and
school-fellows, and immediately
saluted each other; the former
inciting the other to follow his
example. He refused at first, because
he had no money; but
was very unwilling to make
known his real reason. Upon
being pressed still farther, he
said, “he had nothing but gold
about him, which he supposed
<i>Jonathan</i>, the cake man, could not
give him change for, otherwise he
should be glad to eat some.” <i>Jonathan</i>
felt in a leathern bag,
which was fastened before him,
and divided in the middle to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>hold silver and halfpence, and
said, “he had money enough
for the purpose.” <i>William</i> was
sadly disappointed; but as he could
urge no farther objection, gave
up his dear half-guinea with regret,
and eat three plum-cakes
with a worse appetite than usual.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. <i>Graves</i>, in the mean time,
had walked onward in quest of
his grandson, whose stay began
to give him some uneasiness. He
came up with him just as he
was finishing his last mouthful,
and gently blamed him for the
length of his absence, at the
same time inviting his companions
to join him, and to return
to Mr. <i>Sedley</i>’s. They politely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>declined his offer, as they
were engaged to spend the evening
with an uncle.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as they had taken
leave, Mr. <i>Graves</i> enquired after
the success of <i>William</i>’s visit.
“You made me quite uneasy,”
said he, “I hope you have done
a <i>great deal</i> of good. How much
did you give honest <i>Tony</i>? or
had you as much money as you
wanted? I forgot to make that
enquiry, you set off in such a
hurry.”—<i>William</i> blushed, hung
down his head, slackened his
pace, and slunk behind his grandfather
in silent confusion.—Mr.
<i>Graves</i> turned round, and taking
his hand, “What has happened,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>my boy,” said he, “to cover
that open countenance with the
suspicious appearance of guilt?
Or do I injure you, my noble
child, and is it only the blush
of your modesty at the enquiry
of your generosity?” “Indeed,
Sir,” said <i>William</i>, “I feel the
keenness of your reproof. But
if my honesty in confessing can
excuse my fault, you shall be
acquainted with the whole truth.
I went from you with a full
design to relieve poor <i>Tony</i>; but
I soon overtook a <i>Jew</i> pedlar,
and I was so weak as to spend
my money in the purchase of
this glass, and that bilberkit.
Nine-pence I had still left; and
nine-pence would have been something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>for the chimney-sweeper;
but this bird’s nest which I have
in my handkerchief, I am ashamed
of myself, Sir, but I gave that
to the boys for the birds.”
“And was that all your money?”
said Mr. <i>Graves</i>. “Did
you not pay for the cakes you
were eating?” “Yes, Sir,” replied
<i>William</i>. “Then why had you
nothing for the boy?” again enquired
his grandfather. “Because,”
returned <i>William</i>, blushing
still more, “I did not like to
change half a guinea: nor should
I have done it, had not <i>Squander</i>
seemed to think it mean of me,
and I was afraid he would laugh
at my stinginess when we return
to school: for he has always so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>much money, that he does not
care how much he spends.”
“The frankness of your acknowledgment,”
replied Mr. <i>Graves</i>,
“must entirely shield you from
reproof; and you seem to be so
sensible of your error, that I need
not, perhaps, point it out with
any further aggravations. I would
not tire you with my advice, and
yet I feel such an interest in
your happiness, as makes me wish
to observe the improvement which
may arise from any incident that
occurs. Young people are apt
to pass over every action without
reflection; and when a day
is once concluded, they think
no more of their behaviour during
the course of it. Our lives,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>my dear <i>William</i>, are made up
of <i>trifling</i> accidents; but if we
incur guilt by behaving improperly,
the future misery of an
uneasy conscience will be ill repaid
by the enjoyment of any
present pleasure. You should always,
therefore, be upon your
guard; since you see an occasion
to draw you into error, may arise
where you least expect it. To
purchase the toys, or to buy the
birds as the naughty boys had
taken the nest was not wrong;
though if you know where they
got it, I should hope you would
replace it. But when you had
only that two shillings and nine-pence,
I think, some part of it
ought to have been saved for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>purpose on which you set out. But
then, <i>William</i>, a worse part of your
conduct is still to come. You
were convinced that it was <i>right</i>,
that it was your <i>duty</i>, to do something
for <i>Tony</i>; yet you left him
without relief: while the fear of
being <i>laughed</i> at by so silly a fellow
as <i>Jeffery Squander</i>, had more
effect upon you than your pity
for your fellow creature, a boy
of your own age in want. This
weakness, I am much afraid, will
often lead you into danger.
Wicked people will laugh at you
for being better than themselves;
but will by no means like to
share in the miseries which your
follies may incur.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>As he concluded these words,
they arrived within sight of Mr.
<i>Sedley</i>’s house, and were soon discovered
by two children who were
kneeling in the parlour window;
but immediately upon seeing Mr.
<i>Graves</i>, they jumped down, and
came running to meet him. The
eldest was a girl about a year
older than <i>William</i>; and the other,
little <i>Bob</i>, had the day before
left off his petticoats, and honoured
his birth-day with a suit
of new boy’s cloaths.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss <i>Sedley</i> and her little brother
had both been to dine with
a neighbouring gentleman, in
consequence of their parents intention
of conveying their son to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>school; which the reader has already
heard Mr. <i>Graves</i>’s arrival
had postponed. They both expressed
their joy at the sight of
their grandfather, who took <i>Bob</i>
in his arms to kiss him; while
<i>Nancy</i>, with a smile of delight,
pressed her brother’s hand, and
assured him of the pleasure she
felt that she should have his company
a few days longer.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Bob</i> was so impatient, in the
mean time, to shew his dress,
that setting both his feet against
his grandfather’s stomach, he very
nearly pushed himself backwards.
“Look, Sir,” said he,
“Pray look at my buttons! I
shall <i>soon</i> be a man now. I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>four years old yesterday; and see,
I have got a pocket to my waistcoat;
and this is my new handkerchief.”
“Well,” said the
old gentleman, “I will see
them all presently, but let me set
you down first; you had very
near tumbled us both on the
grass; and you are very heavy,
I can tell you, in your new
cloaths.” “I dare say I am,”
returned <i>Bob</i>. “To be sure, Sir,
I am too big to be lifted now
I am in breeches; and besides, I
have got money in my pocket;
so it is no wonder I am heavy, for
Mr. <i>Goodwill</i> the clergyman gave
me six-pence yesterday afternoon,
because, he said, I was such a
good boy, that he was sure I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>should take care and spend it
properly.—And see what a nice
one it is, Sir!” Mr. <i>Graves</i>
took it in his hand, and admiring
it greatly, gave it to little
<i>Bob</i>, who turned it about with
much pride and pleasure as he
walked along, till it unfortunately
dropped down upon the
grass, and was lost from his
sight. “O stop! stop!” said he
in a hurry, “my <i>six-pence</i>! my
<i>own dear new six-pence</i>! what
shall I do?” and immediately fell
upon his hands and knees in
search of his treasure. <i>William</i>
did the same, and <i>Nancy</i> stooped
forward to assist them; while
their grandfather pushed about
the grass with his stick, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>hopes by that mean to discover
it. Their endeavours, for a
long time, were in vain, and
<i>Bob</i>’s impatience became so great,
that he burst into tears.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do not cry, my love,” said
his sister, “I have got a six-pence
which my papa gave me
last <i>Thursday</i> when I finished his
shirts, and you shall have that.”
“But it is bent and ugly,” replied
he: “It is not a <i>new</i>
one: I do not like it: It is an
ugly one.—O my pretty six-pence!
what shall I do for it?”
“Not be a naughty boy! I
hope, <i>Robert</i>,” said Mr. <i>Graves</i>:
“you told me just now, you
were almost a man; but this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>behaviour, and these tears, look
like a baby. I think <i>Nancy</i> is
very kind to you; and I am
ashamed to see you make such a
return to her good-nature. However
there is your six-pence,”
continued he, putting his stick
close to it. <i>Bob</i> jumped at it,
and picking it up, kissed it most
heartily, saying, “I am glad
you are found: I will put you
in my pocket, and never take you
out again when I am walking.”
They soon reached the house;
and found Mr. and Mrs. <i>Sedley</i>
waiting tea for them: to whom
Mr. <i>Graves</i> gave an account of their
walk. During their conversation
two gentlemen who were riding
by stopped their horses, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>looked up at the house. Mr.
<i>Sedley</i> got up, and walking to
the window with his cup lifted
to his mouth, and the saucer in
his left hand, “I wonder what
those gentlemen are looking for,”
said he. “They seem to have
mistook their way.” “O no!
Papa,” replied <i>Bob</i>, “I dare say
they only stand still to look at
my new cloaths. They are surprised
I suppose to see me in
breeches.” “Upon my word,
child,” said his father, “you
think yourself now of prodigious
consequence; but it is very silly
and unlike the man you wish
us to think you, to talk so much
of your dress.——Your brother’s
behaviour,” added he, turning to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Miss <i>Sedley</i>, “puts me in mind
of the little girl we met one
day at Mr. <i>Wilmot</i>’s. Do not
you remember her, <i>Nancy</i>? I
think she was called Miss <i>Gaudery</i>:
with her red silk slip, and
fine gold watch. She looked so
stiff as if afraid to stir. She
would not walk in the garden
for fear it should spoil her shoes;
nor sit close to her companions,
that she might not tumble her
cuffs; nor would she eat any
strawberries, because if one happened
to drop, it would stain
her apron. In short, all her attention
was so evidently fixed
upon her fine cloaths, that she
incurred the contempt of the
company; who all agreed it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>much to be lamented, that her
mind should be neglected for the
sake of adorning her person. I
know that dress is a very favorite
subject with girls. And
what pretty thing have you
got? says one; and let me see
your new cap, says another, when
you have play-fellows come to
see you. Is not that true, <i>Nancy</i>?
And then you pull out your
band-boxes; and this is my
cloak; and this is my furbelowed
apron; and here is my
flounced petticoat; and that is
my feathered bonnet; and in
this drawer I put my shawl.—Tell
me, <i>Nancy</i>, is not that
the way you entertain and are
entertained by your visitors?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>“Those with whom I am intimate,”
replied Miss <i>Sedley</i> blushing,
“I sometimes shew my
new cloaths to; but I do not
wear half of those things you
have named: it would look strange
indeed to see a little girl in a
furbelowed apron; at least, I am
sure we should not call it by
that name. But pray, Sir, inform
me whether you think
there is any thing wrong in
this practice, and I will not do
it for the future?” “I do not
mean, my dear,” returned her
father, “to blame that good-nature
which would engage you
to please your companions with
the sight of a new acquisition;
but to warn you from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>danger of a vain temper, which
is proud of fancied finery, and
imagines its worth  to consist in
the smartness of dress rather
than in real goodness. And I
address myself to <i>you</i> upon this
subject; because I think, that in
general, girls are apt to shew a
greater tendency to this failing
than boys: but I hope my <i>Nancy</i>
has too much good sense to be
proud of any thing which reflects
no honor upon herself, but
as she behaves properly, and makes
a right use of the advantage of fortune.
The pleasure which <i>Bob</i>
has expressed in his new coat,
has not arisen from its being
finer than his other cloaths, but
because he looks upon himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>as so much more like a <i>man</i>
than he was before; but it is a
certain proof from his speaking
so much about them, that it is
a new thing to him; otherwise
he would have thought no more
of the circumstance than does
your brother <i>William</i>. So when
a girl is dressed out to make a
visit, and takes particular notice
of her ruffles, or her frock, or
any other part of her dress, you
may almost always be sure she
is not accustomed to it. You do
not look at those shoes, nor think
of that cap, because you usually
wear them; and you should endeavour
to be as easy in your behaviour
in your <i>best</i> as in your <i>common</i>
garb; otherwise you appear stiff
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>and ungraceful, and will lose every
advantage which your dress is designed
to produce. But above all,
my girl, remember, that good-nature,
affability, and sweetness of
manners, is the charm to render
you agreeable; and will always
have the power of pleasing, independent
of outward decorations.”
“I hope,” said Mrs. <i>Sedley</i>, “that
our <i>Nancy</i>’s good sense will secure
her from an error which
is the strongest mark of an uninformed
mind. She has just
favored me with the sight of a
little poetic piece, which was
occasioned by the behaviour of
the child you have mentioned;
and as you are so well acquainted
with the author, I dare say she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>will oblige you with the perusal.
Mr. <i>Sedley</i> expressed his wishes
to that purpose, and his daughter
immediately fetched them
down, and presented them to
her father, who read as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, my dear,”
said Mr. <i>Sedley</i>, when she had
concluded. “These lines, I
see, are the production of <i>Dick
Wilmot</i>, as he has signed them.
You must know Sir,” added he,
addressing Mr. <i>Graves</i>, “that
our young friend discovers a propensity
to the Muses, and often
employs his leisure in the composition
of such little pieces.
But he has made two long a parenthesis
at the beginning, which
is only excusable from the laudable
motive of praising a sister,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>who is one of the most accomplished
and best tempered girls
I am acquainted with. The design
of a parenthesis is only to
include a short sentence in a
long one, and therefore should
not be too long itself, as the
sense of the author ought to be
complete without it. But when
it is extended to too great a
length, we forget the foregoing
passage, and the continuation of
the subject appears awkward and
perplexing.” “But if the sense
is as good without, then what
is its use?” said Miss <i>Sedley</i>.
“It is sometimes by way of
explanation, my dear,” replied
he, taking up a book from the
table: “as thus, <i>Alexander</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>reaped great advantage from the
fine taste with which his master
(than whom no man possessed
greater talents for the education
of youth) had inspired him with
from his infancy.” “Now perhaps
the reader might not be
acquainted with the character of
<i>Alexander</i>’s master; and this commendation
of him will inform
him, that he was a man of abilities,
and therefore better qualified
for his employment; and
yet the sense would have been
perfect without this addition. But
it sometimes is likewise used as
an exception. Suppose I was to
say, you shall all go to <i>Windsor</i>
to-morrow (except little <i>Bob</i>) to
see the castle and the royal family.”—“O!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>but pray do not
leave <i>me</i> at home,” said <i>Robert</i>,
starting up from the ground,
where he had been sitting spinning
his six-pence on the carpet.
“Pray, Sir, take me with you,
and <i>I</i> will shew you some verses
as well as my sister.” “Will
you?” replied Mr. <i>Sedley</i>; “and
pray where did you get them?
but I am not going to <i>Windsor</i>:
I was only teaching <i>Nancy</i> the
use of a parenthesis.” “Was
<i>that</i> all?” cried <i>Bob</i> in a tone of
disappointment. “But you shall
see the poetry however. I have
it in my <i>pocket</i>,” with an emphasis
he pronounced the word.

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>The next morning was as
fine as the preceding one; and
<i>William</i> and his sister rose in
high spirits with the idea of
spending the day together.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the family assembled to
breakfast, Mr. <i>Graves</i> proposed to
take them to dine with a friend
of his at <i>Windsor</i>, but without
excepting little <i>Bob</i>, who begged
to be of the party. After a
very pleasant ride they arrived at
Mr. <i>Rich</i>’s, who received them
with great affability and politeness.
They found there several
play-fellows, as Mr. <i>Rich</i> had a
son and daughter; and there were
two young ladies and a young
gentleman, who had been likewise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>invited to dine with them.
The name of the eldest was Miss
<i>Lofty</i>: the other Miss <i>Snap</i>; and
the boy was called Master <i>Tradewell</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>As it was early when they
arrived, Mr. <i>Sedley</i>, Mrs. <i>Rich</i>,
and the young folk, took a walk
to see the castle, with which
they were all highly entertained.
On their return they met with
a pretty girl, who was running
along with a basket of apples,
and who stumbling over a loose
stone in her way, fell down with
great violence on the pavement.
<i>William</i> and his sister immediately
hastened to her assistance,
and very tenderly enquired whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>she was hurt; at the same
time assisted her to gather up
the fruit, which she seemed much
concerned about, as the pippins
had rolled to a great distance.
“How far were you going, <i>Fanny</i>,”
said Mrs. <i>Rich</i>. “Don’t be
frightened, my child; your apples
are not the worse, and your
mother will not be angry.”
“They were for you, Ma’am,”
replied she, curtesying and weeping,
“and I was charged to
make haste; but I am sure I
could not <i>help</i> falling.” “To be
sure you could not,” returned
the lady; “and as you are a
good girl, you may stay and
dine at our house if you please.”
<i>Fanny</i> thanked her, and promised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>to ask her mother’s leave so to
do. Mrs. <i>Rich</i> then informed her
company, that the child they had
seen was daughter to a servant
of theirs, who had married a
gardener, and whose good behaviour
recommended her so much,
that she frequently came to play
with her children.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the afternoon the young
party retired to amuse themselves
in the garden; and Miss <i>Rich</i>
asked them if it would be agreeable
for <i>Fanny Mopwell</i> to be
with them? <i>William</i> said, “by
all means;” and <i>Nancy</i> was quite
pleased with the proposal: but
Miss <i>Lofty</i> bridled up her head,
and said, “she had never been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span><i>used</i> to play with such <i>creatures</i>:”
and Master <i>Tradewell</i> said,
“he thought they were better
<i>without</i> her; for a <i>merchant</i>’s
son was rather above a girl of
that sort.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Tom Rich</i>, who had loved <i>Fanny</i>
from her infancy, and whose
mother had been his nurse, was
not a little offended at the scorn
which they expressed for his favorite,
and very angrily told Miss
<i>Lofty</i>, “that if she was <i>poor</i>, she
was <i>good-natured</i>, and would not
refuse to oblige any body.”
<i>William</i> also joined heartily in
her favour; for he was of such
a gentle disposition, that he always
wished to promote the happiness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>of every one he saw;
and <i>Nancy</i> seconded him with
great ardor. Upon this mighty
question, a warm debate ensued.
Miss <i>Snap</i> said, “she
did not care for the <i>girl</i>, but
she had no patience to have her
<i>play</i> so interrupted.” <i>Charlotte
Rich</i>, who was a school-fellow
of Miss <i>Lofty</i>’s, began to be
ashamed of having asked her to
take notice of such an humble
companion; and though she was
in her heart very fond of little
<i>Fanny</i>, yet she felt her pride
hurt at having shewn her such
a degree of regard. So forcibly
does a bad example often operate
upon a mind which would
be otherwise not ungenerous.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>During the dispute, the innocent
cause of it happened to pass
by; and <i>Fanny</i>, with a modest
curtesy, asked Miss <i>Rich</i> how
she did? To which question the
foolish girl, for the reason above-mentioned,
would not condescend
to give her an answer. As she
was a child of great sensibility,
she was a little distressed by
the contempt which <i>Charlotte</i> affected.
She knew too well the
duties of her station to offer to
put herself upon an equality with
the other young ladies; but as
she was always accustomed to be
treated by Miss <i>Rich</i> with the
freedom of an equal, she felt
her contempt as a hardship to
which she had not been used.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>She hung down her head, and
was walking silently away, when
<i>Tom</i> took hold of her gown,
and enquired whither she was
going? desiring her to stay with
him and his friend <i>William</i>, adding,
“that Miss <i>Sedley</i> and <i>Bob</i>
should be of their party; and
they would leave the proud boarding-school
<i>ladies</i>, since that was
their title, to keep company
with the <i>merchant</i>’s son.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss <i>Lofty</i>, who was daughter
of a nobleman, replied, “that
a <i>merchant</i>’s son was no better
than a <i>tradesman</i>; and she was
not over fond of your <i>city</i> gentry.”
This speech equally offended
Master <i>Tradewell</i> and Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span><i>Snap</i>; who, rouzed at the indignity
offered to her rank, declared,
“she always heard, that
a <i>gentleman</i> of <i>fortune</i> was as
good as a <i>Lord</i>; and her father,
who was an <i>Alderman</i>, was known,
though a grocer, to be worth
thousands and thousands of pounds,
and therefore she did not understand
such treatment.” In short,
the disagreement ran so high,
that Miss <i>Snap</i> could not be persuaded
to play at all; and when
the rest of the disputants had
agreed to make up matters, she
would accept of no proposal, nor
join in any diversion which they
offered to her choice. During
the latter part of the engagement,
Master <i>Sedleys</i>, with their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>sister and <i>Tom</i>, had accompanied
<i>Fanny</i> to an arbour at some distance,
where they quietly sat
down to play. Her good-nature
inclined her always to give way to
her companions; and she had been
taught to do whatever her superiors
desired (if it was not wrong)
so that they found her a most
agreeable and entertaining girl,
and rejoiced that they had admitted
her to be of their party.
Among the rest of their amusements,
it was proposed that they
should each tell a story for the
entertainment of the rest; and
as none of the others could immediately
recollect one, <i>Fanny</i>
was desired to begin, which she
very readily did in the following
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>manner, out of a little book
which she had in her pocket.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>John Active</i> was a very good
sort of man, and was beloved
by his neighbours. He was kind
to every body; and would always
help those who were in
distress. As he had a good trade
(though it was a laborious one)
he got a pretty fortune; and he
did not mind the fatigue, for the
sake of providing for his family.
His wife too was a worthy
woman, and always took care
to have things ready against he
came home, received him with
good-humour, and thanked him
for the trouble he took in getting
the money to keep her and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>her children. They had three
daughters; whose names were
<i>Nanny</i>, <i>Susan</i>, and <i>Kate</i>; and she
taught them to read and work;
and when they were gone to-bed,
would sit up to mend their
cloaths, and do what was necessary
for them. While they were
young, this family all lived extremely
comfortable. The parents
were contented and thankful
for their condition; and the
children were as happy as it
was in their power to make
them. But when they grew
older, and ought to have known
better, the two eldest became
perverse and disobedient. They
would not mind what they were
taught; and only grumbled and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>found fault if they were set
to work. In short, they became
so obstinate, that they at
all times did the contrary to
what their parents desired: <i>Susan</i>
one day in jumping from
the top of a gate, which she
had often been forbid to do,
broke her leg, an accident that
confined her a great while, and
cost her father a vast deal of
money for surgeons; and her
mother in lifting her about,
got a hurt in her back, which
never could be cured, and occasioned
her to be lame all the
rest of her life. Any body would
have thought that such an accident
might have taught the
naughty girl to have been more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>obedient for the future; but she
was unmoved by it; and added
to the trouble of nursing her, by
being cross and dissatisfied; and
poor Mrs. <i>Active</i> would often
shed tears at the unkind speeches
which she returned for her care
and indulgence. Nor did <i>Nancy</i>
afford them any greater comfort.
She would never assist in those
things of which she was capable:
but was mighty eager to do
what was out of her power.</p>

<p class='c007'>“One day when her sister
was better, her mother desired
them both to run the seams of
a bed curtain, which she was
making; and begged them to
make haste, as she wanted to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>finish it before night.” They
both looked sullen at her request.
<i>Nancy</i> said, “it was not
her <i>business</i>; and her father might
sleep without curtains:” and <i>Susan</i>
replied, “that though her
leg was mended she would not
do all the <i>drudgery</i> indeed.”
While little <i>Kate</i>, who was much
younger, threaded a needle, and
began to take one of them into
her lap, though it was so large
she could hardly manage it. Mrs.
<i>Active</i> told them to consider their
father had a bad cold; and as
it was a very severe frost, and
a windy night, it would certainly
make him worse. So after she
had insisted upon it, they snatched
up the work, and pulled out their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>needles with such passion and
ill-humour as to break the thread
at every stitch. <i>Susan</i>, who had
got a book to amuse her, and
who sat with her back to her
mother, put it into her lap, and
kept reading the whole time,
without paying any regard to
what she said; and long before
the usual hour of going to-bed,
both sisters pretended they were
so sleepy they could not keep
awake, left their work unfinished,
put on their night caps, and
went away.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As <i>Susan</i>’s book was very
entertaining, they sat up in their
own room to finish reading it;
but thinking they heard Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span><i>Active</i> upon the stairs, they hastily
popped the candle into the closet,
and with their cloaths on jumped
into bed. As they heedlessly
put it upon an under shelf, it
burnt a hole through the one
which was over it, where catching
to some linen, it soon set
the closet in a blaze. This
did not happen for some hours
after they had left it, they having
laid still for fear of being
found but, and not thinking
of the danger, fell asleep,
while the flames burnt through
to Mr. <i>Active</i>’s room, which was
adjoining to theirs; and it was
with the greatest difficulty that
they were saved, he having but
just time to rush in at the hazard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>of his own life, and carry
them down stairs in his arms.
But the house for want of water,
as it was in a country place,
was entirely consumed; nor did
they save any thing, not even so
much as cloaths to cover them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When <i>Fanny</i> had read thus far,
her audience were obliged to seperate
upon a summons to tea.
They were all extremely sorry,
as they wished to hear a conclusion
to her story; and <i>William</i>
begged her to lend him the
book that he might finish it at
home. This proposal <i>Fanny</i> did
not much approve, but at length,
upon a promise of his returning
it by Master <i>Rich</i> before he went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>to school, she entrusted it to his
care, charging him to keep it
clean, and not take the paper off
the cover.</p>

<p class='c007'>In their way home, the young
folk entertained Mr. <i>Graves</i> with
an account of their days amusement,
and bestowed great praise
on <i>Fanny</i>’s good-nature, at the
same time that they blamed the
haughty manners of Miss <i>Lofty</i>
and her companions. “Your
observations, my dear children,”
replied their grandfather, “give
me the highest pleasure, as there
is nothing more truly contemptable
than that pride which arises
from the possession of wealth and
finery. The poor are a more useful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>set of people than the rich;
since to their industry we must
owe all those distinctions that bestow
the conveniences and luxuries
of life. And though the difference
of station was appointed
for the wisest ends; yet, it is
our duty to behave with kindness
to our inferiors, and not
subject them to unnecessary mortifications.
A prudent person
will always endeavour to keep
such company as may suit his
rank, because it is an error to
associate only with those beneath
us, as we cannot learn
from them such qualifications
which are essential to be known;
but a <i>good</i> mind will at all times
pay a tender regard to the feelings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>of those in poverty and distress,
because it is an act of
cruelty and oppression to insult
any who are in circumstances
less happy than ourselves. Instead,
therefore, of being <i>proud</i>
on account of your family and
fortune, you should be thankful
to Providence that you will
have it in your power to assist
others; and remember, that the
higher your rank, and the greater
share of wealth you may possess,
so much the more it is necessary
to set a good example; as
God will expect more from you
in consequence of such advantages,
than from those who by
having fewer opportunities of
instruction, are not so well acquainted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>with their duty. Every
incident, my dears, may afford
you some useful lesson, if you
accustom yourselves to reflect seriously;
and this afternoon has
taught you by experience, that
the benefit of a good education,
the finery of dress, and the distinction
of noble connections, are
altogether insufficient to engage
your love or respect; while the
superior charms of good-nature
and good sense have in the humble
<i>Fanny</i> found means to win
your regard. Remember then,
for the future to cultivate in
yourselves the internal graces of
a generous disposition; and let
the pride and folly of Miss <i>Lofty</i>
and Master <i>Tradewell</i>, be a warning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>to you to shun their errors.
Every degree of grandeur and
ostentation can be but comparative.
If <i>you</i> despise the poverty of
<i>Fanny</i>, or the inferior fortune of
your acquaintance <i>Sam Ivy</i>; Sir
<i>Thomas Young</i>, or your school-fellow
Lord <i>Newson</i>, may look down
upon <i>you</i> with equal contempt;
because they have already each a
title to boast, and have larger
estates to expect than yourself:
and as you would dislike to be
treated with disdain by <i>them</i>, remember
others have equal sensibility:
and always judge by your
own feelings, what is the course
of action you should pursue;
since, to <i>do</i> as we would be <i>done</i>
by, is a rule of the greatest importance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>in life. Master <i>Tradewell</i>
could but ill bear the scorn
with which Miss <i>Lofty</i> treated
a mercantile employment, though
he had joined in her haughty behaviour
to <i>Fanny Mopwell</i>. And
those who are most ready to give
offence to others, can in general
the least submit to such insolence
themselves; because, knowing
their own want of more valuable
endowments, and thinking
such a vain superiority of the
highest consequence, they are
mortified in proportion to their
pride, and suffer the just punishment
of their arrogance in the
folly which causes their distress.”
<i>William</i> thanked his grandfather
for his good advice, to which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>they had all listened with great
attention; and then retired to bed,
with the satisfaction of having behaved
well during the course of
the day. As soon as he conveniently
could the next morning, he
went into his sister’s room, and
taking <i>Fanny</i>’s book from his
pocket, they both sat down in
one chair, with his arm round
her neck; and began to read the
continuation of the story as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. <i>Active</i> and his family
were now left exposed to the
greatest distress. One of his legs
had been terribly burnt in getting
his daughters down stairs;
and the loss of their house and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>furniture it was out of their
power ever to repair. Several of
the neighbours were so kind as
to give them a few cloaths for
the present; and the gentlemen
of the parish, out of regard to
his merit, made a subscription
for him, and gave him some
money for his immediate relief.
With this assistance they took
as cheap a lodging as they could
procure; but were obliged to
live very differently from their
usual manner. The poor man,
though he went out to work,
could earn but little, his leg
growing worse for want of proper
assistance; and the fright of
the fire had had such an effect
on his wife, that she never was
well after. In this state of poverty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>the money which had been
given them was soon spent;
and though many persons had
pitied them at the time, yet
their sufferings were now forgot,
and nobody thought any more
about them. <i>Nanny</i> and <i>Susan</i>,
though their undutiful behaviour
had been the cause of all the
misfortunes which they suffered,
still continued to be ill-tempered
and untractable. They
were discontented with their situation,
and grumbled at the hardship
to which they were reduced;
and though their mother had
got some work to employ them,
yet they were so idle that they
neglected to do it, notwithstanding
they were starving for want.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Poor <i>Kate</i>, indeed, did what she
could; and though she was but
young, proved of great assistance
to her mother. “I will do all
I am able,” she would say, “and
do not grieve, for in time
we shall have more money I
hope.” And when she saw there
was but little for dinner, she
would not eat what she wanted,
in order to leave it for her parents.
Sometimes she would talk
to her sisters, and advise them
to behave better. “I am sure,”
she has said, “we owe a great
deal to our father and mother
for their care; and as they have
worked hard for <i>us</i>, it is but
reasonable that we in our turn
should try to support <i>them</i>.” The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>two elder sisters were at length
provided for, by getting into
place, and going to service. <i>Nanny</i>
was taken by a grocer’s wife to
nurse a young child and go of
her errands, and whatever else she
was capable of doing: and <i>Susan</i>
went to a farmers in the neighbourhood
as an assistant in the
family. It fell to her lot to
carry milk every morning to a
gentleman who lived near the
place where her sister was settled;
and she used frequently to meet
her there, and stay and talk to
her a little. They pursued this
custom for some time without
any bad intention; but one day,
as the place where they stood
happened to be close to a pastry-cook’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>shop, they were tempted
by the sight of some hot buns
to go in and buy one between
them. They found the taste so
delicious, that they would gladly
have eaten more; but considering
the cost would be what
they could not well afford, they
parted for that time, with a
mutual agreement to meet the
next day at the same house, and
renew their treat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>Nanny</i>’s business would not
permit her to be there so early
as her sister, who after having
waited at the door for some time,
entered the shop by herself, and
bought a penny custard, which
she had just finished eating, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span><i>Susan</i> arrived, and with much
pleasure informed her, that a
gentleman had given her a shilling
for her trouble in waiting
upon him during his stay at her
Master’s; and she wanted to consult
her in what manner she
should lay it out. “Suppose,”
added she, “I should carry it
to my mother, it is the first
money I have had, and she is
in great distress?” “Why, yes,”
replied <i>Susan</i>, “they do want money
at home; and so after you
have eaten one of these plum-cakes
let us go: I would have
bought one before had I been
able to pay for it.” “Well!
but,” returned <i>Nanny</i>, “then I
must change the shilling, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>that will be a pity: to carry only
eleven-pence will not look half
so well, and we had better go
without our cakes: we have both
had a good dinner, and perhaps
they have not fared so well: I
think it would be kinder to let
them have it.” So saying, she
was going to leave the shop,
when the pastry-cook’s boy passed
by her with a tray full of
hot cheesecakes. They smelt so
delicious, that <i>Nanny</i> wished very
much to taste them; and her
sister joining in the same inclination,
added, “we shall often
have a <i>shilling</i> given us now we
are in service: it is but a trifle!
what would a shilling buy? My
mother will not <i>expect</i> it; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>therefore will not be hurt, or
vexed about it: come, come, do
not stand thinking any longer.”
“To be sure they are very
nice,” said <i>Nanny</i>, and took up
one in her hand.—It broke!—What
was to be done? It must
be paid for; and when the shilling
was once changed, she argued
that it would look unhandsome
to carry such a trifle to
her parents.—Weak, silly girls!
They spent the whole of it before
they left the shop.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>Kate</i>, in the mean time, continued
with her parents, whose
misfortunes encreased every day.
Mr. <i>Active</i> fell from a ladder and
broke one of his arms, and was by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>this accident reduced to a starving
condition. His wife was attacked
by a violent fever, of
which she would not inform her
daughters, for fear they should
take the infection. These distresses
in a few weeks, as they
were both unable to work, reduced
them to the most wretched
state of poverty; and on the day
that their two daughters were
feasting, as has been related, they
were almost expiring with hunger.
Poor <i>Kate</i>, with weeping
eyes, beheld them both. She had
<i>nothing</i> to give them, and had
exhausted her strength in nursing
and attending them. Her mother
lay on her wretched bed, and
her melancholy father with his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>right arm in a sling sat beside
her. “I will get them something!”
said <i>Kate</i> to herself.
Her father told her it was dinner
time. “Bring what there is,
my good child, for your mother.”
She went to their little
cupboard.—Alas, it was empty!
Not a crumb remained! She
had wiped it clean in the morning,
and those scraps had been
her only breakfast. “Is there
<i>nothing</i>, my child?” added he,
and he looked at his wife,
stroaked his left hand across his
eyes, but not quick enough to
prevent the tears which dropped
upon the sling that supported
his right. “I will fetch something,”
said <i>Kate</i>; and was hastening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>to the door. “Alas!” replied
he, sobbing with distress,
“my <i>last</i> farthing was spent
yesterday.” She went out, however.
“I will <i>beg</i>,” said she
to herself, but I will procure
them something.” She stood in
the street a few moments, not
knowing what to do. At last
she ran as fast as her weakness
would permit (for she was beginning
to be ill with the same
fever which had attacked her
mother.) She ran till she reached
the grocer’s. She enquired for
her sister, but she was not at
home. She begged them to give
her a bit of bread; but the men
in the shop who did not know
her, accused her with being a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>beggar and a thief; and would
not believe that <i>Nanny</i> was her
relation. They threatened to send
her to the house of correction,
and turned her disgracefully out
of doors.</p>

<p class='c007'>Poor <i>Kate</i> wept most bitterly
at this treatment. She was
very timid and had not courage
to reply, but wandered back
again in deeper affliction than before.
As she drew near home,
she felt rather sick; and as she
had scarcely eaten any thing for
several days, she much wished for
something to appease her hunger.
A baker’s shop was at hand,
and she determined to go in and
beg them to give her a roll. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>she saw nobody to apply to.
She called several times, but no
one answered. Loaves of bread,
of all sizes, stood on the counter
before her. “Shall I take one?”
said she: “I am quite unobserved.”
“But is it <i>right</i>?” said
she again to herself. “Shall I
do a <i>wrong</i> thing only because I
am not <i>seen</i>?”—She walked away.
“Shall I go back,” once more
she added, “to my poor father
and mother, and have <i>nothing</i> for
them?”—She sat down upon the
threshold and wept. “It is better
to <i>starve</i>,” at length she exclaimed,
“it is better to <i>starve</i>
than be <i>wicked</i>!” and she walked
away. A gentleman was riding
by in a chaise, and the wind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>blew off his hat. She ran,
picked it up, and gave it to
him; and he tossed her a half-penny
for her trouble. She took
it up with gratitude; and as
she ran back to the bakers, she
repeated aloud to herself, “It is
better to be <i>honest than to steal</i>.”
The owner of the shop was now
returned. She told her distressful
tale, and he gave her a stale
penny loaf for her money. With
what joy did the poor girl return
to her parents.—“Was she
not happier than if she had eaten
an <i>hundred cheesecakes</i>?—In the
afternoon <i>Nanny</i> had leave to visit
her mother. She blushed when
she saw them, and recollected
how she had spent her shilling.”—</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>So far went the story, when
<i>William</i>, to his great disappointment,
perceived he had left the
rest behind him. The cover of
the little book was torn, and
the leaves were fastened together
with a pin, which had dropped
out; and <i>Fanny</i> in giving it
him when they were called to
tea, had, without knowing it,
kept back the rest.</p>

<p class='c007'>He communicated the accident
to his grandfather; and gave him
an account of what he had been
reading; and concluded with
hoping, that <i>Nanny</i> and <i>Susan</i>
would in the end meet with the
punishment which their neglect
of their parents deserved; that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>he should rejoice to hear they
were <i>starved</i> for their barbarity.
“You see, my dear,” returned
Mr. <i>Graves</i>, “that the appearance
of ingratitude is so odious,
that it fills you with abhorrence
only to read an imperfect account
of it, and yet I doubt whether
you who are so warm in your
detestation of the crime, are not
sometimes tempted to commit
it.” “What <i>I</i>?” said <i>William</i>
rather warmly, “I disobey my
parents, and forget them in their
distress! If I had but a mouthful
of bread they should have
it between them; and I am sure
I always do as they desire me.”
“You are a good boy,” replied
the old gentleman; “but you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>have never yet been put to such
a trial. Few persons <i>know
themselves</i>, or are sensible <i>how</i>
they should act in situations
which they have not experienced.
The only way you can prove
your affection to your friends, is
by rendering yourself worthy
their regard. Only remember,
that to do a <i>wrong thing</i> will
give them more uneasiness than
you can imagine; and that their
concern for your welfare is so
great, it would be the heaviest
affliction they could experience
to have you behave improperly;
and, therefore, to merit their
confidence, you must act with
the same attention to their commands
when they are absent as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>when they are present to observe
you.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>William</i> was vexed at his grandfather’s
observation, and told him,
“it seemed to imply a doubt of
his conduct,” Mr. <i>Graves</i> commended
him tenderly; but said,
“he had observed, that he was
often severe in his judgment;
and when he saw a fault in
others, or read of any blameable
character, he was apt to condemn
it without any regard to
that mercy which was a most
amiable attribute, and peculiarly
necessary in creatures, who were
every moment in danger of falling
themselves. Young persons,”
continued he, “are apt to look
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>upon every crime of which they
have not been guilty as <i>impossible</i>
for them to commit: but that
confidence in their own strength
is sometimes a most dangerous
snare to them in future life. I
will give you an instance of this
sort which fell under my own
observation. When I first went
’prentice, there was a young man
about sixteen, with whom I had
been always intimate, and who
was bound about the same time
to an uncle who lived next door
to my master’s. This circumstance
was a great addition to
our happiness, and the more I
saw of him the more I had reason
to esteem him. But there
was one thing I wished had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>been otherwise in his disposition.
His principles were so rigid,
that I was sometimes afraid to
tell him of any inadvertence I
had been guilty of, though he
was about my own age; for he
declared such an abhorrence of
every thing that was mean or deceitful,
as to confess, if one of
<i>his</i> friends should do a dishonorable
action, he would cast him
off for ever.—But the best hearts
may be tempted to evil before
they are aware, if they depend
so much upon themselves as to
be off their guard. He had leave
one evening to visit an acquaintance,
and upon his arrival found
that the family were engaged to
go to the play. They gave him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>an invitation to accompany them,
which for some time he declined,
thinking it not quite right
to do this without his uncle’s
knowledge. At length, however,
as it was an entertainment which
(as he had been but a short time
in <i>London</i>) he had never seen,
he determined to accept their
offer. He felt a secret uneasiness
upon his mind, as he thought
his conduct not strictly right,
and had great reason to suppose
the proposal would by no means
have met with his uncle’s approbation.
His regret was however
forgotten during the representation;
and he would have
been quite happy had his consent
been obtained. The time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>however, went faster than he
imagined, and when he returned
home it was eleven o’clock. He
had unfortunately broken his
watch, and his companions assuring
him it was early, he
sat down with them to supper.
The clock at length struck
twelve; and the hours had passed
so agreeably, that he thought
it had been but eleven. He
rose immediately, and hastened
home, afraid of his uncle’s displeasure,
and angry with himself
for a conduct which his conscience
disapproved.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As he was running hastily
along, full of uneasiness for the
reception he might meet with,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>his foot slipped, and down he
fell against a post.  He was
slightly bruised, and cut his face
by the accident; but the thought
immediately occurred to him to
make that an excuse for his stay;
and as he had mistaken a street
which led him farther from
home, for one which he designed
to have taken; without
any further reflection, he related
a plausible tale to his uncle of
his having lost his way; and as
he had never before told an untruth,
the account was believed
by the old gentleman.—So far
his falsity had escaped detection.
He retired to-bed; but not to
sleep; that comfort he could not
obtain: his <i>conscience</i> represented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>the wickedness of which he had
been guilty, and he could think
of nothing but the crime which
for the first time he had committed.
In the morning he rose
with a heavy heart; for cheerfulness
is only the companion
of virtue. He had too much
false pride to confess his folly;
and the questions which his uncle
put to him, obliged him to
confirm one lie by the addition
of many more.—So easily, my
dear boy, do we sink from one
wickedness to the commission of
another; and so difficult is it
to regain the right path, when
once we have wandered from it.—He
passed a most wretched
morning, occupied with reflections
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>upon his conduct, and entered
the parlour upon a summons
to dinner with a mind
penetrated with remorse. But
guess at his confusion, when the
first object which he saw was
the gentleman he had accompanied
to the play, and who had
called to return him his stick,
which in the haste of his departure
he had left behind. The
explanation that followed, was
such as to mortify him to the
last degree. It not only exposed
his deceit to his uncle, but
to the rest of the company;
and his character was so much
injured by the discovery, that
it was many years before he
could entirely reinstate himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>in their good opinion: and to this
day he is cautious of making a
positive declaration, or profession
of what he will do, for fear he
should be ensnared into evil.”—“It
is in every one’s power,”
said <i>William</i>, “to be good if
they please; therefore, they are
accountable certainly for their
bad actions.” “Very true,” replied
his grandfather, “but take
care that you are never drawn
to the commission of bad actions
by the example or persuasions of
others. And you should remember,
that the end of all your
studies is to make you better by
the force of example. When
you meet with vicious characters,
let the detestation which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>you feel for their crimes be a
warning to you to avoid a similar
conduct; while on the other
hand, every noble action should
inspire you with emulation to
imitate what you applaud. My
hopes,” continued the good old
gentleman, “are fixed upon you
<i>all</i>; but in a particular manner
my cares have been engaged for
<i>you</i>, as I have had a nearer concern
in your education; and I
trust, my <i>William</i>, you will recompence
my solicitude, by becoming
a worthy example to
your brother and sister; for
really I think your misconduct
would break my heart.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span><i>William</i> was generous, frank,
and affectionate. He loved his
grandfather most tenderly; and
pressing his hand, promised his
future conduct should be all he
wished.—But alas! with all his
good qualities, he was in some
respects of too easy a disposition.
He had not resolution to oppose
what he knew to be wrong when
his companions proposed it; and
was frequently drawn into such errors
through his weak compliance,
as he had long occasion to lament.
<i>Good-nature</i> is a great virtue; but
young people should endeavour
to distinguish between what is
<i>kind</i> and what is <i>weak</i>. True
goodness is always obliging to
others, where it can be so without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>acting wrongly. But no politeness
can excuse an ill action;
and those who propose what is
blameable, ought never to be
complied with. We should then,
with gentleness endeavour to shew
them the impropriety of their
behaviour; and if they are too
obstinate to be convinced, leave
them to their folly without
partaking it with them.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>William</i> was engaged to dine
that day at the house of Captain
<i>Fairform</i>, where another boy
of his own age had been invited
to meet him. This gentleman’s
eldest son was handsome, sensible,
and clever: his manner and
address were uncommonly graceful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>and pleasing; and he behaved
so well in company as to
be generally admired. What a
pity was it that such an insinuating
appearance should not have
been equalled by a better heart!
He was so deceitful as to appear
virtuous in the society of
his parents and friends; and
misled them to believe, that he
was as good as he pretended.
I shall pass over all the occurrences
of the meeting, and what
passed between this young gentleman
and his visitors, till after
they had dined; when <i>Harry
Fairform</i> proposed to them to
take a walk. His father desired
them not to go towards the village
of <i>Boxley</i>, as there was a fair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>kept that day, and he did not
chuse they should mix with the
company who frequented it. <i>Harry</i>
promised obedience, and bowing,
set forward with his companions
the opposite way.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as they were out of
sight of the house, young <i>Fairform</i>
turned about, and taking
<i>William</i> by the arm, “Come,”
said he, “<i>Tom Wilding</i>, and you
and I, will go across that field,
and see what is going forward
yonder,” pointing as he spoke to
the place they had been forbidden
to visit. “Why you do not
mean surely to go to the <i>fair</i>?”
replied <i>Sedley</i> with astonishment.
“Have you not promised that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>you would not?” “Pooh! you
filly fellow,” returned <i>Harry</i>,
“Promises and pye-crust—did
you never hear the old proverb?—they
are both made to be
broken. What will my father
be the worse for it, whether I
walk one way or the other? and
I know which will afford me the
most amusement. He is a cross
old fellow to wish to confine
me in such a manner without
reason: I dare not tell him so,
but I promise you, I take care
to do as I please.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The honest heart of <i>William</i>
was shocked at the idea of such
ungenerous deceit. He blamed
him for his principles, and refused
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>to go.—“Nay, then,” said
his companion, “if you will
stay, you must do as you please;
but it was <i>my</i> promise, not
your’s; and if I am willing to
take the <i>mighty</i> guilt upon my
own shoulders, and what is
worse, run the risk of the punishment,
what is that to <i>you</i>?”
“<i>I</i> did not <i>promise</i> to be sure,”
cried <i>William</i>, pausing; “but I
know my friends would be angry,
was I to go without leave,
and especially when the Captain
has desired us so positively <i>not</i>
to do it.”—“The Captain’s <i>son</i>
must answer for that,” interrupted
young <i>Wilding</i>; “that is none
of our business; but if <i>you</i> are
afraid of a <i>drubbing</i>, why that is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>another thing.” “I have no
<i>such fear</i>,” returned <i>William</i> with
indignation; “but I am too generous
to abuse the confidence
of my friends. They believe in
my honor, and it would be base
to make a wrong use of the trust
they repose in me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The two boys, with uplifted
eyes, sneered at this speech.
They ridiculed his notions, and
derided his attention to his parents
when they were absent;
and <i>Jack Careless</i> and <i>Will Sportive</i>
coming up while they were
in debate, they applied to them
on the occasion. All now was
uproar and confusion; each one
trying which should laugh the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>most at our poor distressed <i>Sedley</i>.
His conscience told him it was
wrong to comply; but the example,
the persuasions, and the
ridicule of his companions prevailed,
and he reluctantly set
forward with them to the village.
They soon arrived at the
fair; and walking up to the
booths, surveyed with delight
the various toys with which they
were furnished. Called upon on
all sides to purchase something,
they each began to ask the price
of what most attracted their attention;
and <i>William</i> agreed to
buy a trumpet for his brother:
and afterwards taking up a little
red morocco pocket-book, was
told it would cost six shillings.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>He laid it back on the stall,
saying, “it was too dear;” but
in turning round, the flap of
his coat brushed it down on
the ground, and <i>Will Sportive</i>,
unseen by any body, picked it
up, and put it into his bosom.
The owner soon missed his property,
and charged <i>William</i> with
the theft. This accusation he
warmly resented; but the man
persevered in laying the blame
on him, till a mob was soon
gathered round, and it was determined
he should be searched.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Will Sportive</i>, who had only
taken the book for a frolick,
for the same reason now contrived
amidst the bustle to convey
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>it into his companion’s
pocket; and <i>Sedley</i>, conscious of
his own innocence, grew more
angry at the treatment he met
with; and absolutely refused the
satisfaction that was demanded.
This added to the suspicions
against him, and he was soon
overpowered by numbers. He
held his hands over his pockets,
sunk down on the ground, and
did all that was in his power
to prevent those about him from
the execution of their design:—but
judge of his astonishment,
when after being overcome by
force, the book was found upon
him.—In vain he protested his
innocence. No one gave him
credit, and the general cry of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>“<i>here</i> is a young thief!” resounded
from every tongue. Some
threatened him with a ducking
in a horse-pond, others with a
whipping at the cart’s tail, and
others prophecied that he would
end his days at the gallows, and
come at last to be hanged.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Will Sportive</i>, whose joke was
attended with such serious consequences,
began to repent his
frolick; but had not the courage
to own it, as he was afraid
of drawing a share of the condemnation
on himself. He therefore
left poor <i>William</i> to bear the
blame as well as he could, and
only stood by a silent spectator
of those inconveniences which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>he had himself been the cause
of. The man still continued in
a great passion, and declared he
would take young <i>Sedley</i> before
a justice of peace. Terrified at
this threat, and shocked at the
thought of going to a prison
for a supposed offence, he begged
on his knees for mercy,
and offered all he had about him
as a compensation for a crime
of which he knew he had not
been guilty. For a guinea the
owner of the book agreed to let
him go; but nothing less should
be the price of his liberty. Such
a sum the unfortunate youth had
not to give. He had spent six-pence
for his trumpet, and three-pence
for plum-cakes the day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>before; so that nine shillings
and nine-pence were all he had
remaining; but this would not
satisfy the person he had offended.
His companions offered to
lend him all they were worth,
but even that was insufficient
for the demand. <i>Fairform</i> had
half-a-crown: <i>Tom Wilding</i> could
find but three-pence three farthings,
though he felt in all
his pockets, and kept the expecting
<i>William</i> in an agony of
suspence. <i>Jack Careless</i> threw
down two-pence, but said his
father would be angry if he
parted with his silver. <i>Sedley</i>
looked at him with displeasure.
“Your <i>father</i> angry,” said he:
“if these scruples had been urged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span><i>sooner</i>, it would have become
you better.” “You shall not
<i>have</i> the two-pence,” returned
<i>Careless</i>, taking it up again and
putting it <a id='t128'></a>in his pocket: “if you
do not chuse it, I will not
oblige you against your inclination.”
<i>Will Sportive</i>, desirous to
repair the damage he had done,
offered him all he was possessed
of, which amounted but to thirteenpence-halfpenny.</p>

<p class='c007'>The distressed <i>Sedley</i> had nothing
left, except a silver medal
which his grandfather had given
him that morning, and told him
to keep it for his sake. He
took it from his pocket, looked
at it, and bursting into tears, exclaimed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>“No! not even to save
me from <i>prison</i> would I part
from this.”—A poor chimney-sweeper,
who had come to see
the merriment of the fair, and
who watched the event of the
uproar which this affray had occasioned,
recollecting the features
of <i>William</i> as he turned his head
with the eagerness of despair,
knocked his brush and shovel
together, and feeling in the tatters
of his waistcoat, produced
a shilling. “Will this help
you, master,” said he: “I took
it to-day for sweeping Squire
<i>Nicely</i>’s chimney; but you shall
have it, be the consequence what
it will.”——<i>William</i>’s conscience
smote him.——“I would not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>change my half-guinea for thee,
<i>Tony</i>”—and the tears trickled
down his blushing and repentant
cheek.—The man insisted on
having the medal; but <i>William</i>
would not consent. For a long
time he refused, till at length
it growing late, he was terrified
with apprehension, and his companions
declared they would stay
no longer. So overcome by their
importunity, he yielded it up,
thanked <i>Tony</i> for his kindness,
which he promised to repay the
next day, and with a melancholy
countenance accepted his
discharge, and went back to Captain
<i>Fairform</i>’s.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>As they did not chuse to return
directly from the village,
they were obliged to go a farther
away about; so that it was
near the dusk of the evening
when they reached home. <i>Harry</i>
told a plausible tale to excuse
their stay, and said, “they had
met with their two play-fellows,
and been walking with them.”
Young <i>Sedley</i> sat in silent vexation
without uttering a syllable,
and soon after took his leave, and
returned to his father’s.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he drew nigh the gate, he
began weeping afresh; and instead
of the pleasure and alacrity
with which he usually entered;
and the joy which he always felt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>at meeting with his friends, he
crept softly along, oppressed with
the consciousness of having acted
<i>wrong</i>; and finding the coach
gates open, sneaked unobserved
into the house. He stood for
some time in the hall, wanting
the courage to meet his assembled
friends; till hearing his
grandfather’s voice, he listened to
know what he was saying. Mr.
<i>Graves</i> was speaking to little <i>Bob</i>.
“Yes,” said he, “I have given
your brother and sister a medal
exactly like that; and now I
shall see (<i>for my sake</i>) which of
you will keep it the longest.”
To express what the poor fellow
felt at that moment, is almost
impossible. He ran up into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>his own apartment, and throwing
himself with his face upon
the bed, sobbed out, “What
shall I do? What can I say?”
At length after weeping some
time, he determined, as he really
felt a violent head-ache, to plead
that as an excuse, and to go
to-bed immediately. With this
resolution he composed his countenance
as well as he could,
and slowly walked into the parlour.
His brother, with that
fondness which he always expressed,
directly brought the present
Mr. <i>Graves</i> had given him,
and jumping as he spoke, pressed
<i>William</i>’s arm, and looking up
in his face, “Is it not a <i>nice</i>
medal?” said he, “Let me look
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>at your’s, to see if they are <i>exactly</i>
alike.”—The poor boy was
covered with blushes; and as
<i>Robert</i> repeated his question, he
peevishly replied, “I have not
got it about me.” He then mentioned
the pain in his head, and
wished his friends good night.—The
kind concern which they
expressed for his indisposition,
added greatly to his uneasiness.
“How little,” said he, “do
I deserve their tenderness! and
how unworthy do I feel of their
solicitude! If they knew in what
manner I have behaved out of their
sight, they would think me deserving
of punishment and contempt.
How will <i>they</i> be able to rely upon
me, when I cannot depend upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span><i>myself</i>? I <i>knew</i> it was wrong
to go with <i>Fairform</i>, yet I went:—and
now all these troubles are
the consequence of one bad action.
I think I will never more
be persuaded to do what is not
strictly right.”—Such was his
firm resolution at that instant;
but though his heart was noble,
generous, and open to conviction,
it was <i>weak</i> in the moment of
temptation. He wanted <i>resolution</i>
to complete his character;
for with many virtues, and an
excellent disposition, he was easily
persuaded to act contrary to
his judgment. Hence he was
frequently seduced by his companions
into such errors as gave
him lasting cause for repentance.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>In the present instance his regret
for his fault was sincere.
He wept till he fell asleep; and
his first thoughts in the morning
were an earnest wish that
he had returned to school. “All
the pleasure I have felt on this
addition to my holidays, does
not pay me for my present pain;
since nothing,” said he, “is so
terrible as a guilty conscience!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Who now would have imagined,
that under the sense of this
conviction and suffering, from
<i>one</i> deviation, he would directly
have sunk into another of a
worse kind?—With a melancholy
countenance he left his
room, and was going through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>the hall into the garden, when
<i>Harry Fairform</i> entered at the
opposite door, and joining him,
they walked out together.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why you look still more pitiable,”
said his visitor, “than
when we parted last night: surely
your old square-toes did not
give you a drubbing! I came
on purpose to know how you
came off after the loss of your
money?” “A drubbing!” returned
<i>William</i> with indignation:
“no indeed! neither my father
or grandfather ever beat me in
their lives: I am not afraid of
<i>that</i>, I assure you. At present
they do not know how much I
am to blame; but I would give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>any thing in the world that I
had not gone with you to the
fair.” “Why then, <i>Sedley</i>,” replied
his companion, “you are a
greater fool than I thought you.
My father is pretty free with
his horse-whip; and when he finds
out that I have disobeyed him,
he makes me feel what he calls
<i>military discipline</i>, till I can neither
sit, stand, or go; but had
I nothing more to fear than one
of old <i>Graves</i>’s mumbling preachments,
it would be a great while
before I should look thus dismal.”
“For shame!” exclaimed
<i>Sedley</i>, who loved his grandfather
to the highest degree, “for
shame! do not utter such sentiments:
if you can only be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>governed by a <i>horse-whip</i>, you
<i>deserve</i> to feel its strokes: but
I would have you know, that I
scorn to be kept within bounds
merely by the fear of punishment.
I wish my friends to <i>depend</i>
upon me in their <i>absence</i>,
as well as if they could <i>see</i> all
my actions; and it is from the
consciousness of having abused
their confidence, that my looks
shew that sorrow which you so
much ridicule. The loss of that
<i>medal</i> too,” added he, bursting
into tears, “which my grandfather
gave me to keep for his
sake, what must he think of my
<i>affection</i>, when he knows on
what occasion I parted with it?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span><i>Fairform</i> in vain used every argument
to afford him consolation;
his distress encreased as the hour
of breakfast approached; and neither
ridicule or advice had the
power to render him composed.
When just as they were returning
to the house, <i>Harry</i> stopped, and
in the middle of the gravel-walk
picked up little <i>Bob</i>’s medal,
which he had a few minutes
before dropped from his
coat-pocket, in taking out his
handkerchief. “Here,” said he,
his eyes sparkling with pleasure;
“now I hope you will dry your
tears: take this, and have no
further dread of detection.”—<i>William</i>
stretched forth his hand
in a transport of delight; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>immediately recollecting himself,
“It is not mine,” said he:
“<i>O that it were!</i> I dare say my
brother has lost it.” “And will
you not take it then!” exclaimed
the astonished <i>Fairform</i>:
“What a ridiculous scruple is
this! If <i>Bob has</i> lost it, it is
but a piece of <i>negligence</i>; and
no creature need be acquainted
that you have found it; as they
are exactly alike you cannot be
discovered; and only think how
angry they will be, if they know
all the circumstances of our last
night’s frolick.”——Poor <i>Sedley</i>
paused—every reproach which
he deserved, and the reproof
which he dreaded, rose in sad
prospect to his mind. <i>Harry</i>’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>persuasions seconded his inclination,
and encreased his fears.
The moment was critical to his
virtue. Honor forbad him to
do such a base action, while his
apprehension of his friend’s  displeasure
inclined him to run the
hazard of <i>future</i> remorse to escape
from <i>present</i> shame. The struggle
of his mind was great, and
it ended nobly for a moment.—“No!”
said he with firmness,
“I have suffered enough already
from doing wrong, I will not
be so ungenerous as to injure
my brother, and deceive my
friends: I will trust to my
grandfather’s indulgence: I will
honestly confess the whole truth,
and let my sorrow expiate my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>fault.” “For pity’s sake,” returned
<i>Fairform</i>, “do not be so
rash: if you have no regard for
yourself have some consideration
for me. You agreed to be of
our party, and now you will
involve me in distress. If you
tell the whole to Mr. <i>Graves</i>,
he will say, that I seduced you
to do what you would not otherwise
have been guilty of, and
will prevent our meeting in future.
I know his rigid notions
of obedience: he will tell my
father, and his punishments are
so severe, that my heart sickens
at the thought—Cruel, unkind
<i>Sedley</i>! I came on purpose to give
<i>you</i> comfort, and you will heap
these evils upon me in return.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>I may have acted wrong last
night; but I am sure I would
not be thus unfriendly to you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This argument was directly
suited to the generosity of <i>William</i>’s
disposition. He could not
bear to give pain to another.
To make his companion suffer
through <i>his</i> means, seemed to him
so mean and cowardly, that all
the more powerful reasons of
truth and virtue were considered
as inferior to this one consideration;
while from motives of the
highest good-nature, by viewing
the affair in a false light, he at
length yielded to <i>Fairform</i>’s persuasions;
and what no temptation
on his <i>own</i> account could effect,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>the solicitude for <i>Harry</i>’s safety
induced him to comply with.—A
striking lesson to young persons,
of the danger which must
arise from bad company; and
an alarming caution to all: since
without <i>prudence</i> and <i>resolution</i> a
good disposition may be led into
the commission of evil, even
when they intend to do right.—For
a long time they debated on
the subject; till at length overcome
by his companion’s entreaties,
he put the medal in his
pocket, and added, “I shall
keep this as a monument of my
<i>folly</i>, in first yielding against my
conscience to go with you to
the fair: <i>that</i> has been the foundation
of every inconvenience,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>and now I see not <i>where</i> the evil
will <i>stop</i>. Let this warn <i>you,
Harry</i>, for the future, that however
you may escape detection,
every disobedience will bring its
own punishment.”—</p>

<p class='c007'>A repeated call to breakfast
now obliged them to go in.
Young <i>Fairform</i> paid his compliments
with that grace which
distinguished him upon all occasions,
and without embarrassment
sat down by Mr. <i>Sedley</i>. <i>William</i>
placed himself in the windowseat,
and could scarcely answer
the enquiries which were put to
him about his health. He had
lost the confidence of an innocent
mind; and his behaviour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>was confused, bashful, and silent.
<i>Harry</i> soon took his leave, and
Mr. <i>Graves</i> invited his grandson
to take a walk. Master <i>Sedley</i>
would at that time have willingly
been excused; but having
no reason which he could urge
against it, he prepared to go:
when just as they were ready
to set off, little <i>Bob</i> came out
of the garden in great distress,
saying, “he did not know <i>how</i>, or
<i>where</i>; but he had lost his medal!”—<i>William</i>
coloured like crimson!—He
made him no answer,
but turning round, stooped down
at the same time, as if looking
for something.—“O! there is
a good boy, do look for it,” said
<i>Bob</i>: “you are very kind, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>I do not think I lost it here: I
know I had it this morning.”
“You have not kept it long for
my sake,” said his grandfather:
“I dare say <i>William</i> and <i>Nancy</i>
can both shew theirs.”—Miss
<i>Sedley</i> pulled hers from her pocket.
Her brother was going to
do the same, but his conscience
would not let him draw forth
his hand. He held the medal
between his finger and thumb,
but did not dare to bring it out
to view.—“Do not cry, <i>Bob</i>”
said Mr. <i>Graves</i>, “you are a
little boy, and are not used to
be entrusted with money: I will
get you another, and your brother
shall take care of it. He
loves me so well, that I dare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>say he will be able to produce
his, when I am dead and gone.”—<i>William</i>
could not answer—but
the tears trickled down his
cheeks.—His grandfather embracing
him, told him not to
be concerned. “I am an old
man, my dear boy, and cannot
expect to live many years longer;
but do not grieve for that circumstance:
when you look at the
medal which I gave you, though
but a trifle in itself, let it remind
you how much I loved
you, and how earnestly I wished
to promote your happiness. Remember,
my child, that you
can never be comfortable, unless
you have a clear conscience;
and let every testimony of your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>friends affection to you, be a
remembrance to act with honor,
generosity, and integrity.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Sedley</i> made no reply, but by
his sobs. The caresses of Mr.
<i>Graves</i> wounded him more than
the keenest reproaches. He would
have confessed all, but the fear
of drawing <i>Fairform</i> into disgrace
kept him silent; and he set
forward on his walk with an
uneasiness too great to be described.
In vain did his venerable
companion endeavour to
engage him in conversation:
he was too conscious of deserving
blame to join with his
usual freedom and gaiety. At
length, as they ascended to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>rising ground which opened to
a very extensive prospect, Mr.
<i>Graves</i>, pointing to the village
where <i>William</i> had lately been
in search of his chimney-sweeper
acquaintance, enquired, “When
he had seen him? and whether
he had yet fulfilled his intention
of giving him any money?”—This
question was too important
to admit of immediate answer:
if he told <i>when</i>, he might
be asked <i>where</i> he had met him?
and that would amount to a
confession of all he had taken
such pains to conceal. He hesitated
for some time, till his
grandfather observing his confusion,
took his hand, and with
tender seriousness thus addressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>him.—“I have seen with uneasiness,
my dear boy, that some
secret burthens your mind, nor
do I wish for your confidence,
unless you can <i>willingly</i> repose it
in my affection. Perhaps I may
be able to advise you—speak
your difficulties, and let not mistrust
or anxiety overspread your
features.” “I do not deserve,”
said the repentant <i>Sedley</i>, “that
you should treat me thus kindly;
nor am I at liberty to tell you
the subject which distresses my
heart. Another is concerned, or
greatly as I have been to blame,
I would this moment confess
it all.” “You best know,
my love,” returned Mr. <i>Graves</i>,
“whether you have made any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>promise which honor would oblige
you to keep sacred; but remember,
that you may be drawn into
guilt, by a too steady adherence to
a bad cause; and be assured, that
person cannot be your real friend,
who would engage you to conceal
from your parents, what you
think they ought to be acquainted
with.”—A pause now ensued,
and <i>William</i> after debating some
time, was going to confess the
whole: when a man with a little
girl came in sight; whom
upon a nearer view, they discovered
to be <i>Fanny Mopwell</i>.
They immediately renewed their
acquaintance; and she informed
them that she had come the
morning before on a visit to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>her uncle, who kept a little shop
in the village of <i>Boxley</i>, and had
invited her to be present at the
fair. <i>William</i>, with his grandfather’s
leave, asked her to pass
the day with him; and as Mr.
<i>Sedley</i>’s family was well known
in that part of the country, her
uncle who was with her, consented
to her going.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our young gentleman was
much rejoiced at having a companion
whose presence might interrupt
any farther conversation;
though to take such a walk with
his grandfather was at any other
season what he most wished for.
At their return he presented
<i>Fanny</i> to his mother and sister,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>who both received her with great
pleasure. As for little <i>Bob</i> he
sat weeping in the window, sucking
the corner of his pockethandkerchief,
and now and then
gently touching a fly on the
glass of the window, to see it
walk from place to place.——Again,
<i>William</i> felt the stings of
remorse. He went out into the
garden, and taking the pocket-piece
once more in his hand,
determined to restore it to its
right owner. “My brother shall
not be thus distressed for my
crimes: I will not be so base,
let the event be what it may.”
With this resolution he again
rejoined the company; and going
up to master <i>Robert</i>, said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>with a smile, “Will this cheer
your spirits? I have found your
treasure.” <i>Bob</i> eagerly jumped
down to take it, and throwing
his arms round his brother’s
neck, held him almost double
to receive his caresses. “Where
did you find it? said he. Thank
you! thank you a thousand times!”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>William</i>’s delight was damped
with the recollection of how
little he deserved his acknowledgments.—A
bad action interrupts
the enjoyment of every satisfaction,
and transforms all our
pleasure into pain.—He was
then obliged to give an account
of the place where he had
discovered it; but carefully concealed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>how long it had been in
his possession; leaving every one
to imagine he had but just
picked it up. His feelings, however,
on the occasion were so
uncomfortable, that he retired to
his own apartment to think of
the occasion in solitude. <i>Bob</i>,
in the mean time, skipping and
jumping about with the lighthearted
pleasure of innocence,
carried his dear medal to <i>Fanny
Mopwell</i>, desiring her to observe
its beauties, and declaring he
would always carefully guard it
for the future. The girl looked
at it some time, and then said,
“she had one just like it, which
a man of her uncle’s acquaintance
had given her that morning;”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>and taking it out of a little iron
box which she had bought at
the fair, said, “it was too
large to go in a red striped one
in which she kept all the rest
of her money.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. <i>Graves</i> begged he might
see it, as those he had given his
grand-children were of great age,
though they had been so well
preserved, and he thought were
extremely scarce. So laying it
down on the table while he
put on his spectacles, he afterwards
took it to the window,
and examined it very minutely;
and turning round, begged <i>Fanny</i>
would tell him if she knew
how the man had gotten it. <i>Fanny</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>replied, “she had heard him
say, he received it the night before
from a saucy boy who was
going to steal a book from his
stall; but that she knew nothing
more about it.” The old
gentleman thanked her, and went
out of the room. He walked
up stairs, and going into his
grandson’s chamber, found him
writing at his bureau.—“I do not
wish to interrupt you, my dear,”
said he, “but pray lend me
your medal for a moment, as I
want to compare it with one I
have in my hand.”——<i>Sedley</i>’s
cheeks were the colour of crimson:
he was too honest to tell
a falsehood; but his confusion
left him not a word to say.—“I-I-I,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>stammered he out,
“I-I-I have not”—and burst
into tears. “<i>William!</i>” said his
grandfather gravely, “Tell me
the truth.”—He could make no
answer for some time but by
his sobs, till the question being
again repeated, he took Mr.
<i>Graves</i> by the hand, and in an
agony of grief proceeded as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed Sir, I will not <i>deceive</i>
you. I have been very much
to blame; and one crime has involved
me in many others; but
if you can now forgive me, I
think I shall never do so again.
When I went to Captain <i>Fairform</i>’s
yesterday, <i>Harry</i> wanted me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>to go with him and <i>Tom Wilding</i>
to the fair. His father had desired
him not, and I thought it
wrong to go; but they laughed
at me so much for my squeamishness,
and would have it I
was afraid only of <i>punishment</i>,
knowing <i>that</i> not to be my motive;
against my <i>conscience</i> I consented.
When we got there I
took hold of a <i>plaguy</i> pocket-book
intending only to ask the
price; and finding it to cost six
shillings, I laid it down again,
as I could not afford it. The
man soon after said I had <i>stolen</i>
it. I knew I was innocent, and
denied the charge. He wanted
to feel in my pockets; which I
thought very insolent, and would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>not let him. However, among
them, they would do so, and
my resistance was in vain:—and
to be sure <i>there</i> it <i>was</i>!—and
<i>Brestlaw</i> must have conjured it
there, for I cannot imagine how
else it was done. So then, Sir,
there was such a mob about me
you cannot think; and I was
abused and called a thief, and I
do not know what; and he declared
he would send me to the
justice, unless I would give him
a guinea: and amongst us <i>all</i>
we could not muster one, and so
at last I was forced to let him
have my medal; but indeed, Sir,
I did not till the <i>very last</i>; and
I have been miserable ever since.”
“The <i>guilty, William</i>, will ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>be so,” returned Mr. <i>Graves</i> very
seriously; “and I am sincerely
sorry to rank you in that number;
but tell me when you felt
for it in the morning, was it
in your pocket? You know it
could not be, why then did
you suffer me to think the contrary,
and to commend you while
I partly blamed your brother?”
“You have taught me, Sir,”
replied he, “that an honest confession
is the best reparation for
a fault. I wish I had done it
sooner, but <i>Harry Fairform</i> persuaded
me to keep it <i>secret</i> for
his sake. I do not wish to lay
the blame upon <i>him</i> to make <i>myself</i>
appear less guilty; but his
bad advice made me take my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>brother’s medal, which he found
in the garden, and I have kept
it till just now, when I could
not be easy longer to detain it.
And now, Sir, you know the
whole;—if you can trust my
promise for the future, I will
never again behave so unworthy
of your affection; and if you
knew what I have suffered for
my present fault, it might incline
you to pity and forgive
me.”—Here he ceased, held
down his head, nor had courage
to look up.—</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. <i>Graves</i>, with great kindness,
took him by the hand,
“Your <i>honesty</i>,” said he, “pleads
much in your favor, and as you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>feel a conviction of your fault,
I hope I may rely upon you
for the future. The end of reprehension
and punishment, is but
to <i>amend</i> the offender: and if
your heart is truly <i>generous</i>, an
immediate <i>forgiveness</i> of your error,
will bind you most strongly
to future watchfulness. Let this
instance, however, teach you that
<i>candor</i> of disposition which you
ought to exercise for <i>others</i>; and
remember that although, as you
justly observed, “every one may
be good if they <i>please</i>,” yet that
circumstances do sometimes arise,
where the best hearts may be
<i>seduced</i> or surprised into guilt:
and therefore, though you should
guard your own conduct with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>peculiar care, yet you ought never
to forget every charitable
allowance for the faults of <i>others</i>.
It is rashness, presumption, and
folly, to condemn those actions
of which we know not the cause,
the temptation, or the motive.
But as to the character of <i>Harry
Fairform</i>, you may fairly conclude
it to be improper for your imitation.
Vice cannot be divested
of guilt; and he must be extremely
wicked who can laugh
at a parent’s prohibition, and wilfully
persuade another to do
wrong. His advice this morning
was founded in <i>meanness</i>, <i>selfishness</i>,
and <i>deceit</i>; and thus, my
dear boy, have you been led on
step by step from the commission
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>of one bad action to another;
till you have lost the calm peace
which <i>innocence</i> only can bestow,
and feel your mind a prey to
the uneasy sensations of <i>guilt</i>.
Be assured, my child, that if you
pursue that course, it is still
more thorny. Had you added
to your crimes a <i>lie</i>, I should
have detected you immediately,
as the man to whom you gave
the medal, presented it to <i>Fanny
Mopwell</i>, and I have it now in my
hand. This <i>W. S.</i> I scratched
on it myself in this particular
place, that I might know in
case either of them were lost
to which it belonged; and the
initials of your brother and sister
you will find in theirs. Consider
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>then the improvement that
you may reap from this transaction.—However
in secret any
ill action may seem to be committed;
yet some unthought of
and unexpected circumstance may
discover it. Little did you think
this morning of seeing the child
who is below; and still less was
you apprehensive when you invited
her home, that she would
be the person to bring your
medal to me. Let this convince
you, then, that if you do wrong,
you are ever liable to <i>detection</i> by
the most unlikely means, and in
consequence are open to <i>disgrace</i>.
<i>Security</i>, my dear child, is the
certain attendant on <i>Virtue</i>: an
<i>honest</i> heart has no mean secret
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>to <i>conceal</i>; and therefore, is at all
times free from those uneasy
cares, with which you have this
morning been so much distressed:
it needs no evasion, and is above
the use of any. Cherish, therefore,
this openness of character which
is so truly amiable, by avoiding
every thing which your <i>conscience</i>
tells you is improper.
That inward monitor is in such
cases your best director. If you
feel <i>uneasy</i>, and are conscious
you are acting as your friends
would condemn, be not afraid
of <i>ridicule</i>. You may suffer from
its shafts for a few moments,
and may find it disagreeable to
be laughed at by those who are
more foolish and more wicked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>than yourself; but in a little
time this will be over, and afterwards
you will enjoy the approbation
of your friends, and your
own heart: and this, my boy,
is a noble recompence. As for
doing wrong from the principle
of not fearing <i>punishment</i>, it is
the weakest argument that can be
urged. A boy who is not afraid
to <i>deserve</i> chastisement, must have
lost every principle of honor:
and though your friends have
always treated you with generosity,
it is because you have
hitherto been <i>obedient</i> and <i>good</i>
in return. Nor would it be to
their credit to let you escape
with impunity, if you should
pursue a different conduct. Never,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>therefore, boast that you are
not <i>afraid</i> of the rod, but that
you are determined never to incur
the smart: that you will
never be persuaded to a <i>mean action</i>,
and <i>therefore</i> it is an object
which can cause you no terror.
I know your heart is generous,
but you are easily persuaded.
You must fortify yourself in this
particular, or you will be in
great danger of error in your future
life. <i>Steadiness</i> of <i>principle</i>,
my dear <i>child</i>, is absolutely necessary
to form a great and good
man. You love your brother,—but
to oblige a worthless boy,
you consented to <i>injure</i>, to <i>deceive</i>,
and to <i>distress</i> him. Did
not his unsuspecting innocence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>wound you, when he begged you
would <i>look</i> for his medal, and
thanked you for your trouble?—Thus
it is, that wickedness of
any kind, hardens the heart.
However, I flatter myself, you
will take warning from this instance
of your misconduct, and be
taught, that it is impossible to
fix bounds to a <i>bad action</i>, or
to say, I will go on so far in
error, and then I will stop:
when once you consent to the
smallest deviation from innocence,
it is not possible to determine
how deeply you may be involved
in guilt, or to what lengths of
mischief or wickedness your first
fault may conduce.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span><i>William</i>, with the greatest contrition,
promised to be more
cautious for the future; and his
grandfather after sealing his forgiveness
with repeated embraces,
left him to recover his former
composure.—His mind now in
some measure relieved from the
heavy burthen with which he
had been oppressed, soon regained
a sufficient degree of calmness to
rejoin his friends; though still
the consciousness of the late transactions
abated his vivacity, and
made him bashful and silent.
His thoughts during the morning
had been wholly engaged with
his own concerns; but when
dinner was over, he recollected
that he had promised to return
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>the shilling to <i>Tony</i>, which he
had so generously lent him in
his distress. Unwilling to renew
the subject with any of his relations,
he was again distressed
for money; but resolving to keep
his promise, he applied to his
sister for two shillings, which she
immediately gave him, and he
set off full speed on his way to
the village, to find his sooty
friend. For some time before he
arrived at the place, he heard
the screams of an object seemingly
in violent pain. As he approached,
they sounded fainter
and more exhausted; and when
he reached the spot, they ceased
entirely.—But judge of his disappointment,
terror, and compassion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>when he beheld the unfortunate
<i>Tony Climbwell</i>, unbound
from a tree by his inhuman
master, who had been beating
him with a leather strap, and
had afterwards given him a blow
on the head with his brush,
which had stunned and deprived
him of sense, in consequence of
which he fell to the ground, and
was left there with a kick from
the same brutal wretch, and
threatened,—“that if he did not
soon get up, he would come and
rouze him with a vengeance.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>William</i> went to him with an
intention to raise him; but found
he could not stand, nor return
him any answer to his enquiries.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>At a little distance, however, he
discovered the boy who had been
<i>Tony</i>’s companion at their first
meeting; and after calling him
some time in vain, went up to
him, and begged to know for
what crime his fellow apprentice
had been so cruelly used. “I
am afraid of going to help him,”
said <i>Jack</i>,—“but Master has beat
him because he did not bring
home the shilling which he had
yesterday for sweeping ’Squire
<i>Nicely</i>’s chimney. He told master
as <i>how</i> he could bring it him
to-day; and master did wait till
the afternoon; but now he <i>was</i>
in such a passion, that he said,
“he would kill him;” and I was
afraid as <i>how</i> he would, and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>believe he has, I do not see him
stir; and sure he would get up
if he could, for fear of a second
drubbing.” “And has my
crime been the occasion of <i>this</i>
evil too?” said <i>William</i>: “Well
might my grandfather say I did
not know where the mischief
of an error may stop. My poor
<i>Tony</i>! what shall I do to recover
thee? and how shall I recompence
thy sufferings? sufferings
too which <i>I</i> have occasioned!”—With
this lamentation he returned
to the unfortunate object
of his pity, who after a heavy
groan opened his eyes.—“<i>Tony!</i>”
cried <i>Sedley</i>, endeavouring to raise
him, “my dear boy, how do
you do?”—The voice of compassion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>sounded so strange to
him, that he looked amazed at
his friend; who repeating his
question, begged him to get up,
and if he could, to walk forward
with him a little way.</p>

<p class='c007'>A chimney-sweeper is accustomed
to ill usage; and <i>Tony</i>
had not fallen into the hands of
a master who would spare him
his full share of suffering.—He
arose, however, with <i>William</i>’s
assistance, and crept on till they
came to a field-gate, over which
he scrambled with difficulty, and
then sat down under a hedge,
which concealed him from observation.—<i>Sedley</i>
with tears entreated
him to forgive him for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>not having sooner discharged his
debt, and for being the occasion
of bringing him into so
much trouble; “but why,” said
he, “did you not come to me,
and you might have been sure I
would have paid you immediately.”
“Ah! master,” replied <i>Tony</i>, “I
thought you would; and so this
morning I went to his honor’s at
the great house, where I first saw
you, and the gay coach, and the
long tail nags; and so I <i>axed</i>
for young master, for I did not
know your name; and the coachman
I fancy it was, said, “I
was a pretty fellow to <i>axe</i> for
young master truly; but that,
however young master, was not
at home.” I then said you owed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>me a shilling, and begged him
to pay it for you, and I dared
to say you would return it.
Upon this he bid me go about
my business for an impudent
knave; and giving me two or
three hearty smacks with a long
horse-whip he had in his hand,
sent me out of the court-yard.”
“How very unfortunate!” cried
<i>Sedley</i>; “this must have happened
while I was out with my grandfather;
but I will now pay you
immediately,” added he, giving
him the two shillings he had
brought. “I have no more at
present; but the first money I
get, you shall share it I promise
you.” “I lent you but <i>one</i>,” said
<i>Tony</i>, “so you have given me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>this too much.” “Keep it, keep
it,” replied <i>William</i>, “I only wish
that I had more to give.”—</p>

<p class='c007'>At this instant little <i>Jack</i>
(whose fear of his master had
kept him from visiting his companion,
but who had watched
him into the field) came running
to <i>Tony</i> with information
that he might go home, for
that his tormentor was gone to
the ale-house.—The boy immediately
got up, and said, “he
would make the best of his way,
and take the opportunity of going
back; for that his mistress
was the kindest creature in the
world, and would be glad to see
him again.”—<i>William</i> was determined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>to accompany him;
and they soon reached the cottage
together.—The poor woman
was holding one hand over
her eye, the other sustained a little
infant whom she was suckling,
and who looked up at her
every now and then with a smile,
while her tears dropped on its
innocent face. A girl about two
years old was standing by her
knee, and crying for some victuals,
and to be taken up, mammy.
Another child at a broken
table, was trying to reach a bit
of stale crust covered with soot,
that his father had tossed out of
his pocket.—Such was the scene
young <i>Sedley</i> beheld at his entrance;
and which presented a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>striking contrast to the elegance
he had been always accustomed
to.—“What is the matter, mistress?”
cried <i>Tony</i>, in an accent
of compassion and concern.—At
the sound of his voice, she
looked up, and shewed her eye,
which was swelled in such a
manner she could scarcely see.—“Oh!
my poor boy, how are
you?” she replied, “I thought
you had been killed, and by interceding
in your behalf, provoked
your master so much, that he
gave me a blow so severe I really
thought it would have ended all
my troubles together.—But who
is that young gentleman?” added
she.—<i>Tony</i> briefly related the account
of their late meeting, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>he had before informed her of
the occasion of their acquaintance,
and that he had lent <i>William</i>
the shilling, which had
caused them so much trouble.</p>

<p class='c007'>The children now became more
clamorous for food; but she told
them she had nothing to give
them.—<i>Tony</i>, however, shewed
the money he had received; and
promised if they were good, they
should have a quartern loaf. He
then dispatched <i>Jack</i> to fetch
one, whose speedy return afforded
all parties great satisfaction.
The eagerness with which
they devoured the stale bread,
occasioned <i>Sedley</i> the highest astonishment.
They each thanked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>him for his kindness, when
told they owed it to him; and
he experienced more pleasure
in having contributed to their
comfort, than any amusement had
hitherto afforded him: yet his
delight was much damped by the
recollection of the pain he had
occasioned; and the bruise on
poor Mrs. <i>Blackall</i>’s eye was an
addition to all the other mischief
which had attended his
fault. He thought it time, however,
to take his leave, and wishing
them a good night and a
speedy recovery, set out on his
return home.—<i>Fanny</i> was gone
when he arrived; and he was
not a little disappointed that he
had lost the opportunity of enjoying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>her company, and still
more, that he had forgotten to
ask for the rest of the book,
which contained the account of
Mr. <i>Active</i> and his family; or to
return the part which she had
lent him. The next morning
he sent the servant to deliver it
to her at her uncle’s, as he had
promised to return it before he
went back to school.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. <i>Graves</i> having been rather
indisposed the preceding evening,
did not breakfast with the family;
and his grandson very
soon retired to his apartment in
order to amuse him with his
conversation.—“You are very
kind, my dear boy,” said he,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>“to favor me with your company;
but as your holidays are
nearly over, I do not wish to
confine you to an old man’s
room, as I am sensible that more
lively entertainments are better
relished at your time of life.”—<i>William</i>
assured him that his attendance
was voluntary; and then
informed him of his visit to the
poor chimney-sweeper, and all
the circumstances which had attended
it.—“Unhappy <i>Tony</i>!”
replied Mr. <i>Graves</i>, “his fate is
a severe one! and yet, my child,
it is but a few days ago, since
you wished to be in his situation.
Do you not now feel the
folly of seeking to change your
state in life at a venture, only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>because you are dissatisfied with
some trifling circumstance which
disturbs you at the present moment?
I would not wish you to
be insensible to the grief of
parting with your friends. That
heart which is destitute of affection
and gratitude, is unworthy
to be ranked with human
beings. But do you consider,
that an opportunity of pursuing
your studies is a blessing which
you ought to value as inestimable;
and instead of repining at
your fate, you should be thankful
that your parents have it in
their power to give you this
high advantage. Never, therefore,
for the future, allow yourself
to judge by outward appearance;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>nor let any agreeable
prospect either in the affluent or
the indigent, incite you to wish
yourself in the condition of another;
since you may be assured,
<i>that</i> state in which you are placed
is the best suited to <i>you</i>. Higher
wisdom than our’s directs every
event; and it is well we are not
left to determine our own situation.”—“I,”
said Master <i>Sedley</i>,
“as I am now convinced, have
indeed <i>reason</i> to be satisfied; but
sure <i>Tony</i>, exposed to the world
without a friend, left to the savage
cruelty of an inhuman
master, obliged to <i>labour</i> for his
<i>bread</i>, and to <i>starve</i> when he
has earned it,—surely, Sir, <i>he</i>
may wish to change, and not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>be blamable for being discontented.”
“No one, my dear,”
returned Mr. <i>Graves</i>, “can
stand excused for murmuring against
Providence when we know
that the world is not left to
the confusion of chance. We
have reason to be easy under the
most afflictive circumstances. <i>Tony</i>
wished to be in your place on
<i>Monday</i>; and had he been metamorphosed
in person and situation,
with the remembrance of
his former state in his mind, he
would probably for some time
have been much happier. But
supposing him to have had <i>your</i>
ideas, he would have been, as you
then stiled yourself, <i>the most
miserable creature in the world</i>;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>and even wished for that very
state which now excites all your
compassion. The miseries of poverty
are great: they call for
your pity: they have a right to
expect your relief. But this
world is not the <i>only</i> hope of
the <i>good</i>. Riches are not to be
considered as your <i>own</i> property.
They are <i>lent</i> you to be well
bestowed. Every one is accountable
for his portion, be it great
or small. You have now only
a few shillings, or it may be a
guinea at your disposal. As you
use the little you have at present,
in all probability in the
same manner you will bestow
the possessions you will have in
future. Accustom yourself, therefore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>to consider you should lay
by a part of your small stock to
relieve the poor <i>now</i>, and you
will find increasing pleasure in
the power of being more liberal
hereafter. Our <i>vices, William</i>, in
every state will be productive of
misery. No situation is necessarily
unhappy. If the <i>rich</i> are
<i>wicked</i>, they can have no enjoyment;
and the same cause will
add double distress to <i>poverty</i>.
<i>Tony</i>’s master is drunken, passionate,
and prodigal. He wastes
his small gains at the ale-house,
beats his apprentice without reason,
abuses his wife, and injures
his children. This causes misery
to himself and to his whole family.
But these evils are not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>to be reckoned as attendant upon
poverty: they would equally destroy
the felicity of the man of
fortune. A bad temper spoils
the relish of every enjoyment:
a good one sweetens the toils
of labour; nay, can mitigate sorrow,
sickness, and want.—I called
the day before yesterday on a
poor family who live in a cottage
adjoining to <i>Tony</i>’s master. Mr.
<i>Scrapewell</i>, just risen from a neat
but shabby bed; was placed in
an old wicker chair on one
side the door, to feel the refreshment
of the air; while his
eldest daughter, a girl of about
fifteen years of age, appeared busy
in putting the room in order;
and when I entered was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>sweeping the sand on the floor
with a little heath broom. Another
girl was picking some parsley,
which she put into a bason
of water, or pipkin I believe
they call it, for it had yellow
stripes and black spots upon it,
and I should not have noticed it,
if I had not afterwards thrown it
down by accident and broke it.
Three or four other children were
playing about; and the youngest,
near six months old, was asleep
in a cradle, which he rocked
every now and then with his
foot. They placed a seat for
me, and I enquired how large a
family he had?” “O! Sir,” replied
he, “we have nine; and
that is my eldest. We struggle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>hard; for it is a great many
to maintain. My first four put
us almost out of heart, as my
wife had them very fast, and
used to grieve, and fret, and vex
herself to think where we should
get bread; but I told her God
would fit the back to the burden,
or the burden to the back;
and I tried to comfort her all
I could, and used to say, Why
<i>lookee</i> now, <i>Beckey</i>! when we were
<i>alone</i> we did but live, and when
we had <i>one</i> child we could do
no more; so I trust if we have
a dozen we shall do as much. But
yet, Sir, I own my own heart
failed me, when I thought how
<i>fast</i> money <i>went out</i>, and how
<i>slow</i> it <i>came in</i>, though I worked,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>and worked my fingers to the
bone. Yet I prayed God to
bless us, and hitherto, though
we have been driven to many a
hard pinch, thanks to his mercy,
we have kept out of the workhouse;
and often when I have
been at my last farthing, and
we have lived within an inch of
starving, he has raised us up
some unexpected friend, and we
have jogged on again much as
usual. So this has taught me <i>never</i>
to despair; and I am determined
to put the best foot forward,
and hope we shall do again
yet, though I have been laid up
with an ague and fever these six
weeks.”—As he finished this
account, his wife returned from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>the field with her gown on her
arm, her green stays left open on
account of the heat, and her cap
tied up over her head. She looked
hot indeed; and dropping me a
curtsy as she entered, affectionately
enquired after her husband:
then taking up the infant, kissed
it, suckled it, and gave it to one
of the girls to nurse, while she
went back again to her labour,
after eating a few mouthfuls of
bread and cheese. Love, harmony,
neatness, good-humour, civility,
and kindness, dwell in their little
cot, and yet, <i>William</i>, their riches
are not greater than the chimney-sweeper’s.
Virtue and œconomy
only make the difference.
While the one squanders his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>small gain at the ale-house, the
other is laying up every farthing
as a provision for his children;
and his good conduct ensures
him assistance and protection from
all who know him. Add to this
one consideration, which is more
than all the rest, that the blessing
of Heaven will attend the
good, and keep that mind in
peace which is staid on its support.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Mr. <i>Graves</i> concluded this
sentence Mr. <i>Sedley</i> softly opened
the door. “I thought you had
been asleep, Sir,” said he, “or
I should have been with you
sooner. I am afraid this young
man has disturbed you.” “O!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>not at all,” returned the old
gentleman, “his company is
always a cordial to me. I forget
the infirmities of age when
I see my children and grand-children
round me; and I am
sorry we must so soon part from
<i>William</i> as you mentioned this
morning.” “He must go to
school this week,” said his father.
“We shall all grieve to
lose him; but his learning cannot
be neglected. He will not
wish, I hope, to waste this most
important part of his life without
its due improvement; and
now is the time to lay the
foundation for every future excellence.”
“But is not the culture
of the <i>heart</i> then,” replied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>the melancholy <i>Sedley</i>, “is not
that the most essential point?
and I am sure if I improve in
the knowledge of the classics, I
do not in the science of Virtue:
and pray of what use is it
to learn the metamorphoses of
<i>Ovid</i>? that <i>Arachne</i> was converted
into a spider,—<i>Narcissus</i> <a id='t200'></a>transformed
to a flower,—that <i>Pyramus</i> and
<i>Thisbe</i> were turned into mulberry-trees,—and
the rest of the fabulous
stories of the poets? What
is it to me that <i>Æneas</i> went to
<i>Carthage</i>,—that <i>Dido</i> stabbed herself
when he departed thence; or that
he afterward, conquered in the engagement
with <i>Turnus</i>; and the rest
of the history with which we are
plagued in <i>Virgil</i>? And as to the
care of my <i>morals</i> I am under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>much greater temptations, from
the bad examples of my school-fellows,
and from wanting the
kind advice of my friends, than
I could be at home. And as I
am not designed either for a clergyman
or counsellor, I do not
see any great necessity for my
learning so <i>very</i> much.” “I am
sorry to see you thus averse to
study,” said his father, “as it
is of the utmost consequence to
your appearance in life. Do you
consider, that without a cultivated
understanding, a thorough
knowledge of history, and an
acquaintance with <i>Homer</i>, <i>Virgil</i>,
<i>Terence</i>, <i>Ovid</i>, and those authors
who you seem so much to
despise; you can never make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>an agreeable companion to men
of sense. By the perusal of history
you will learn to distinguish
truth from fable, and to know
what part is founded on fact,
and what on the imagination
of the poet. These authors will
store your mind with images the
most sublime and beautiful, assist
your judgment, and form your
taste; since their works have been
esteemed the model for composition
in all succeeding times.
Without a constant attention,
therefore, to improve in reading
and understanding them, you will
be ignorant of those subjects
which every author refers to;
which are frequently the foundation
of conversation, and which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>afford hints to the sculptor and
the painter for their finest pieces.
You will stare with stupid wonder
at every object of this kind
that you meet with, unknowing
to what they refer, or what
they mean to represent. Besides,
as the Heathen Mythology, or
account of their Gods, is connected
with this study, it is
absolutely necessary you should
be acquainted with it. Many
things that now appear absurd in
the account of their worship,
had in their original a deeper
moral: this though idle boys
may not understand or search for,
it would much improve you to
be taught. When you read that
<i>Minerva</i> the Goddess of wisdom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>was produced out of <i>Jupiter</i>’s
brain; the poets intended to represent
by it, that the wit and ingenuity
of man did not invent the
useful sciences, which were for
universal advantage derived from
the brain of <i>Jupiter</i>; that is,
from the inexhausted fountain of
the <i>Divine Wisdom</i>, from whence
not only the arts and sciences,
but the blessings of knowledge
and virtue also proceed. The
helm, the shield, and all the different
symbols which belong to
her character have each their
particular meaning: to instance to
you only in one of them. The
owl, a bird supposed to see in
the dark, was sacred to <i>Minerva</i>,
and painted upon her images,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>as the representation of a wise
man, who scattering and dispelling
the clouds of ignorance
and error, is clear sighted when
others are stark blind. So you,
who take all the fictions of the
poets for nonsense and folly,
would, if you had learning to
comprehend their meaning, not
only be entertained with their
beauties, but improved by the
moral they contain. The more
you know, and the greater proficiency
you make in study, the
higher pleasure will it afford
you; but while you consider
your lessons as <i>tasks</i> which you
are to get by heart, and what
will be of no use to you in
future, you defeat the purpose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>of your education, are unhappy
now, and will be despised and
contemned hereafter. A <i>gentleman</i>
should be still more superior
by his <i>merit</i> than his <i>fortune</i>:
his knowledge should be
more general and diffusive than
is required for any profession
whatever. He ought to be acquainted
with the great authors
of ancient and modern times,
understand the constitution and
laws of his own country; and
by the contemplation of every
noble character, learn to form
his own to perfection. Do not,
therefore, entertain so mean an
opinion of yourself, or your future
consequence, as to rely on
your <i>estate</i> alone for respect. Let
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>religion be your guide and chief
study; but let history, poetry,
with every branch of polite
and useful learning, be considered
as <i>essential</i> to your education.”—</p>

<p class='c007'>Here ceased Mr. <i>Sedley</i>, and
his son looked down in timid
silence, fearful he had offended
his friends by the indifference
he had expressed for his exercise.
Mr. <i>Graves</i>, however, encouraged
him, by kindly adding,
“When you have mastered the
first steps, you will mount upward
with alacrity. The beginning
of every attempt is difficult;
but be of good courage; persevere,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>and you will find it afterwards
pleasant, easy, and agreeable.”</p>

<p class='c007'>During the foregoing conversation,
<i>Jeffery Squander</i> had called
to invite <i>William</i> to dine with
him, and afterwards to return
to school in his father’s coach;
and Mrs. <i>Sedley</i> now introduced
the young gentleman up stairs.
The offer was so convenient (as
it was before intended he should
go back the next morning) that
it was accepted with satisfaction
by all but the person whom it
most concerned. Yet poor <i>Sedley</i>
was ashamed to express his reluctance
while in company with
his school-fellow; and made no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>opposition to the proposal. The
tears, however, which he endeavoured
to suppress, would officiously
start into his eyes.—His
father patted him on the back,
and said, “it would make but
a few hours difference.”—His
grandfather stroaked his cheek as
he turned round towards the
window to hide his emotion.
This affected him still more, and
his mother letting fall her scissars,
he picked them up; but
as she was stooping for them at
the same time, he saw that
her eyes shewed equal concern;
which, unwilling to have observed,
she had not immediately
wiped away, and he received a
tear upon his hand.—It was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>necessary he should immediately
retire to prepare for his departure.
He was spared the pain
of taking leave of his brother
and sister, they happening to
be from home; a circumstance
which he much regretted, as
they would not return till the
evening.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he had given a little
indulgence to his grief in private,
he returned to his friends,
and endeavoured to assume a more
cheerful countenance than suited
the affliction of his mind. But
he remembered the <i>chimney-sweeper</i>,
and tried to be satisfied. At
length his companion being impatient,
he was obliged to take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>a hasty leave of his beloved relations,
and followed by their affectionate
wishes for his welfare,
accompanied <i>Jeffery Squander</i> with
a melancholy heart to dinner, and
to <span class='sc'>School</span>.</p>
